## 🎯 HOW TO USE BITLY TRACKING

### **After Sending Email to Heathwood Hall:**

1. Go to Bitly dashboard
2. Find link: `echodeed-demo`
3. Check **"Clicks"** (shows if they clicked)
4. Check **"Click Date/Time"** (shows when they engaged)

### **What Each Click Tells You:**

✅ **Demo link clicked within 24 hours** = HIGH INTEREST → Call them!  
✅ **Lead magnet clicked but no demo** = WARM → Send follow-up with demo link  
⚠️ **No clicks after 3 days** = COLD → Send follow-up email  
❌ **No clicks after 7 days** = VERY COLD → Call directly or move to nurture

---

## 📧 UPDATING YOUR EMAILS WITH BITLY LINKS

### **Example: Heathwood Hall Email (Updated)**

**Before:**
```
Would you be open to a 5-minute demo?
```

**After (with Bitly):**
```
Would you be open to a 5-minute demo? Try it yourself first: 
https://bit.ly/echodeed-demo

I also wrote a white paper for Episcopal schools: 
https://bit.ly/echodeed-episcopal
```

## 📊 TRACK IN YOUR CRM

**After sending each email, update your CRM:**

| School | Email Sent | Link Clicked? | Which Link? | Action Taken |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Heathwood Hall | 10/31/25 | Yes (11/1) | Demo + Episcopal | Schedule demo! |
| Dominion Ridge | 11/1/25 | Yes (11/2) | Demo only | Send follow-up |
| Immanuel Christian | 11/1/25 | No | N/A | Follow up 11/4 |

**This data tells you:**
- Who's interested (clicked links)
- What resonated (which links they clicked)
- When to follow up (based on engagement)

---

## 🎯 ADVANCED: UTM PARAMETERS (Optional)

If you want even MORE data (like which school, which email version), add UTM parameters:

### **Example for Heathwood Hall:**

**Original:** `https://www.echodeed.com`

**With UTM:**
```
https://www.echodeed.com?utm_source=email&utm_medium=outreach&utm_campaign=heathwood_episcopal
```

**Then shorten with Bitly** → `https://bit.ly/echodeed-heathwood`

**Why this helps:**
- Track which school came from which email
- See if Episcopal messaging works better than compliance messaging
- A/B test different subject lines

**BUT:** Only do this if you're comfortable with analytics. Start simple with basic Bitly first.
