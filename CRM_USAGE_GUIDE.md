## 📧 Tracking Responses

### **When a school replies:**

**Example: Heathwood Hall responds**

```
From: jsmith@heathwood.org
Subject: Re: "Unique worth and beauty of all human beings"

Hi Tavores,

This sounds interesting. Could we schedule a quick call to discuss?

Best,
Jennifer Smith
Head of School
```

**Your CRM update:**
```
Response Status: Replied - Interested
Response Date: 11/3/2025
Notes: "Head of School interested, wants to schedule call"
Next Action: "Send Calendly link for demo"
Action Due Date: 11/3/2025 (TODAY - respond fast!)
```

**Send response immediately:**
```
Hi Jennifer,

Great to hear from you! Here's my calendar for this week:
👉 https://calendly.com/tavores-echodeed/demo

Looking forward to showing you how EchoDeed aligns with 
Heathwood Hall's Episcopal values.

Best,
Tavores
```

**Update CRM again:**
```
Next Action: "Wait for demo to be scheduled"
Action Due Date: 11/5/2025 (if no response in 2 days, follow up)
Notes: "Sent Calendly link 11/3 at 2pm"
```

---

## 🔄 Follow-Up Workflow

### **No response after 3-4 days? Send Follow-Up 1**

**Filter spreadsheet:**
- "Response Status" = "No Response"
- "Initial Email Sent Date" = 3-4 days ago

**Example: Trinity School hasn't replied**

```
School: Trinity School
Initial Email Sent: 11/1/2025
Response Status: No Response
Today's Date: 11/5/2025 (4 days later)
```

**Action: Send Follow-Up 1**

**Email:**
```
Subject: Following up - 11+ year teacher retention at Trinity

Hi Dr. Johnson,

I sent a quick note last week about how EchoDeed could support 
Trinity's exceptional teacher retention (11+ years avg experience 
is rare!).

In case it got buried, here's a 1-pager showing how daily student 
appreciation messages reduce teacher turnover without raising 
salaries:
👉 [Link to lead magnet]

5-minute demo available this week if you're interested.

Best,
Tavores
```

**Update CRM:**
```
Follow-up 1 Sent: 11/5/2025
Lead Magnet Sent: 5 Questions PDF
Response Status: No Response (still)
Next Action: Check for response
Action Due Date: 11/8/2025 (3 days later)
Notes: "Sent follow-up + lead magnet. If no response by 11/8, send breakup email"
```

---

### **Still no response after Follow-Up 1? Send Follow-Up 2 (Breakup Email)**

**Filter spreadsheet:**
- "Follow-up 1 Sent" = 3 days ago
- "Response Status" = Still "No Response"

**Example: Trinity School still hasn't replied**

```
School: Trinity School
Follow-up 1 Sent: 11/5/2025
Response Status: No Response
Today's Date: 11/8/2025
```

**Action: Send Breakup Email**

**Email:**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi Dr. Johnson,

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing:

a) You're swamped (totally get it - principals work 80-hour weeks)
b) This isn't a priority right now
c) My emails ended up in spam

If (a) or (c), just reply "still interested" and I'll follow up 
in January after the holiday rush.

If (b), no worries! I'll close your file.

Either way, no hard feelings.

Best,
Tavores

P.S. If you do want that 5-minute demo, here's my calendar: [link]
```

**Update CRM:**
```
Follow-up 2 Sent: 11/8/2025
Response Status: No Response - Breakup Sent
Next Action: Mark as Closed Lost if no response
Action Due Date: 11/11/2025 (3 days later)
Notes: "Sent breakup email. If no response, close and move on"
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for CRM Success

### **Tip 1: Update in Real-Time (Not End of Day)**

❌ **Don't:** "I'll update the CRM tonight after I send all emails"  
✅ **Do:** Send email → Immediately update CRM → Next school

**Why:** You'll forget details. Real-time = accurate data.

---

### **Tip 2: Use "Notes" Column Liberally**

**Capture everything:**
- "Head of School mentioned they're currently using Character Strong ($12K/year) - contract up for renewal in March"
- "School has 600 students, budget is tight, very interested in cost savings angle"
- "Clicked demo link 3 times but didn't schedule - seems interested but hesitant. Follow up with Episcopal Values PDF"

**These notes become gold** when you're preparing for demos or closing deals.

---

### **Tip 3: Color-Code Rows (Google Sheets)**

**Visual prioritization:**

1. Select row for Heathwood Hall (Tier 1 ⭐⭐⭐)
2. Right-click → **Format cells**
3. Choose light green fill
4. Result: Top priorities visually stand out

**Color scheme:**
- 🟢 **Green:** Hot leads (replied, interested)
- 🟡 **Yellow:** Warm leads (opened, no reply yet)
- 🔴 **Red:** Cold leads (no response after breakup)
- ⚪ **White:** Not contacted yet

---

### **Tip 4: Set Calendar Reminders for Action Due Dates**

**Google Calendar sync:**
- When you set "Action Due Date" = 11/5/2025
- Create calendar event: "CRM: Follow up with Trinity School"
- Set reminder: 9am on 11/5

**Never miss a follow-up again.**
