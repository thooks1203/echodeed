# Demo Call Pricing Script - EchoDeed

**When to Use:** After showing the demo, when they're excited about the platform

## 🎯 THE PRICING CONVERSATION FLOW

### **Step 1: Qualify Their Budget FIRST**

Don't mention your price until you know what they're spending now.

**Ask:**
```
"Quick question before we talk about implementation - what are you 
currently using for character education? Are you using Character 
Strong, Panorama, or something else?"
```

**Listen for:**
- ✅ "We use Character Strong" → They're paying $8K-$12K
- ✅ "We use Panorama" → They're paying $10K-$15K
- ✅ "We don't have anything formal" → No budget comparison
- ✅ "We built something in-house" → Opportunity to show ROI

---

### **Step 2: Anchor to Their Current Spend**

**If they're using Character Strong ($8K-$12K):**

```
"Got it. Most schools tell us they're paying $8,000 to $12,000 for 
Character Strong. The challenge we hear is: it's curriculum only - 
no parent engagement, no teacher appreciation, and you're still 
doing compliance documentation manually.

EchoDeed is $7,500 per year. You save at least $500 to $4,500 
annually while getting features Character Strong doesn't offer.

Plus - and this is only available for a limited time - if you're 
one of our first 10 partner schools, you lock in $6,000 per year 
forever. Even when we raise prices next year, you stay at $6,000.

Does that pricing work within your budget?"
```

**If they're using Panorama ($10K-$15K):**

```
"Panorama's great for assessment data, but it's pricey - most 
schools tell us $10,000 to $15,000 annually. And it doesn't 
actually engage students in building character day-to-day.

EchoDeed is $7,500 per year - you save $2,500 to $7,500 annually. 
Plus you get daily student engagement, parent notifications, and 
teacher appreciation that Panorama doesn't provide.

And if you're one of our first 10 schools, you lock in $6,000 
forever - that's a $4,000 to $9,000 annual savings.

Sound reasonable?"
```

**If they don't have a formal program:**

```
"Most schools budget $8,000 to $12,000 for platforms like Character 
Strong or Panorama. EchoDeed is $7,500 - and you get everything we 
just walked through: student engagement, parent notifications, 
teacher appreciation, and automated compliance.

For context, that's about $8 to $15 per student depending on your 
enrollment. Most schools tell us that's less than their annual 
copier lease.

Plus, if you're one of our first 10 schools, you lock in $6,000 
per year forever. Would that work for your budget?"
```

## 🎯 HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### **Objection 1: "That's still expensive for us"**

**Response:**
```
"I totally understand. Let me ask - what are you currently spending 
on character education, whether that's curriculum, professional 
development, or staff time on compliance documentation?"

[They'll usually realize they're spending more than they think]

"Here's another way to think about it: If EchoDeed saves your team 
10 hours per month on compliance paperwork alone (90% reduction), 
that's 120 hours per year. At $50/hour for administrator time, 
that's $6,000 in saved labor costs. The platform basically pays 
for itself just in time savings."
```

---

### **Objection 2: "We need to think about it"**

**Response:**
```
"Absolutely - this is an important decision. What specific questions 
do you need answered before moving forward?"

[Listen, answer questions]

"I'll mention one thing: the $6,000 early adopter pricing is only 
for our first 10 schools. After that, it goes to $7,500. I'm not 
trying to pressure you - just want you to have all the info. Would 
it help if I sent over a proposal with everything we discussed?"
```

---

### **Objection 3: "Can we do a free trial first?"**

**Response Option A (Soft No):**
```
"I appreciate that - and I don't typically do free trials because 
most schools tell me they just sit unused. But here's what I can do:

If you're one of our first 10 schools, you get $6,000 pricing locked 
in forever. That's $1,500 off regular pricing annually. Over 3 years, 
that's $4,500 in savings - basically like getting a free year.

Plus, I'll personally onboard your team and provide white-glove 
support for the first 90 days. If it's not working, we can have a 
conversation at the end of the semester. Fair?"
```

**Response Option B (Pilot Program):**
```
"I hear you. Let me offer something better than a free trial:

What if we do a 3-month pilot partnership? You pay $1,500 for the 
spring semester (January-March). If your team loves it and you want 
to continue, that $1,500 becomes your first payment and you lock in 
$6,000/year forever.

If it's not working after 3 months, no hard feelings - we part as 
friends.

This gives you a real commitment (not a dusty free trial), but it's 
low-risk. Sound fair?"
```

---

### **Objection 4: "We need board approval"**

**Response:**
```
"Totally understand - that's smart governance. What does your board 
need to see? I'm happy to provide:

• ROI analysis (time savings + cost comparison)
• Case study / testimonial (from other schools using it)
• Executive summary (1-page overview for board packet)
• Join your board meeting via Zoom to answer questions

When's your next board meeting? I can have everything ready by then."
```

## 💰 PRICING TIERS (Memorize These)

| School Size | Regular Price | Per Student | Early Adopter | Per Student |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **500 students** | $7,500 | $15/student | $6,000 | $12/student |
| **750 students** | $7,500 | $10/student | $6,000 | $8/student |
| **900+ students** | $7,500 | $8.33/student | $6,000 | $6.67/student |

**Key Talking Point:**
*"For Heathwood Hall's 903 students, that's $8.30 per student at regular pricing, or $6.64 per student as an early adopter. Character Strong charges $13+ per student and doesn't engage parents or teachers."*

## 🎯 THE CLOSE

### **After Answering All Questions:**

```
"Based on everything we've discussed, does EchoDeed feel like the 
right fit for [School Name]?"

[Wait for answer]

"Great! Here's what happens next:

1. I'll send you a simple one-page agreement outlining the $6,000 
   early adopter pricing (locked in forever)
   
2. We schedule a kickoff call with your team (counselors, teachers, 
   admin) to plan the launch
   
3. I personally handle the setup and training - white-glove service
   
4. We target a launch date of [2-3 weeks from now]

Sound good? I can have the agreement in your inbox within the hour."
```

---

## 🚀 EARLY ADOPTER URGENCY

**Use this to create urgency WITHOUT being pushy:**

```
"Just so you know - we're capping early adopter pricing at 10 schools 
total. Right now, we have [X] schools in conversations, so there are 
about [10-X] spots left.

I'm not trying to pressure you - you should absolutely take the time 
you need to decide. I just want you to know that after we hit 10 
schools, pricing increases to $7,500 (and you'd miss the locked-in 
$6,000 forever pricing).

Does that timeline work for you?"
```
