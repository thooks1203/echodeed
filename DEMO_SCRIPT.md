## Key Talking Points (Reference Sheet)

### **Unique Differentiators:**
1. ✅ **Parent notifications of GOOD behavior** (not just discipline)
2. ✅ **Dual rewards** (students AND parents earn together)
3. ✅ **Anonymous kindness culture** (reduces social comparison stress)

5. ✅ **95% time savings** on service hour verification
6. ✅ **Behavioral monitoring WITHOUT liability** (human review, no automated crisis interventions)

### **What We're NOT:**

## Objection Handling

### **"We already have a service hour tracking system"**
> "Perfect! EchoDeed exports to x2vol and CSV formats - we integrate with what you have while adding photo verification for 95% time savings. Think of us as the character celebration layer on top of your existing administrative tools."

### **"How much does this cost?"**
> "Our pricing is per-student and depends on school size. What's unique is our sponsor partnership model - local businesses offset costs by investing in your students' rewards. Many schools find it's revenue-neutral or even revenue-positive. Let's talk about your specific situation."

### **"What about student privacy?"**
> "All kindness posts are completely anonymous - no names, no profiles. Parents only see notifications about their own child. We're COPPA and FERPA compliant. Students feel safe celebrating kindness without social pressure."

### **"Our teachers are already overwhelmed"**
> "That's exactly why we built the photo verification system - to REDUCE teacher workload, not add to it. Service hour approval went from 15 minutes of phone calls to 30 seconds of clicking. Teachers save hours per week."

### **"What if students post inappropriate content?"**
> "Three-layer protection: Pre-posting filter blocks profanity, AI pattern detection flags concerning content, and everything goes through a teacher review queue. Teachers make all decisions - no automated interventions. We designed this to avoid legal liability."

### **"How do we measure success?"**
> "We track student engagement (posts per week), parent notification open rates, service hour completion, and school climate survey data. Early pilots are also exploring attendance correlation. We'll work with you to define success metrics that matter to your school."
