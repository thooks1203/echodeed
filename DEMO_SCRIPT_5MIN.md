## [0:00-0:45] THE PROBLEM & HOOK

**[ON SCREEN: Show cluttered desk with paperwork, stressed administrator]**

"Let me ask you something: How many hours did your team spend last month documenting character education compliance for the state?"

**[Pause for effect]**

"Most principals tell us 15-20 hours per month. That's nearly **250 hours per year** on paperwork alone."

"What if I told you EchoDeed reduces that by **90%** while actually **improving** student belonging and attendance?"

**[ON SCREEN: "90% Paperwork Reduction | 75-80% Cost Savings"]**

"And it costs **75 to 80 percent less** than traditional character education programs like Character Strong or Panorama."

"I'm Tavores Vanhook, and in the next 5 minutes, I'll show you how Eastern Guilford High School transformed their school culture with a platform that makes character education effortless, measurable, and real."

## [0:45-1:30] STUDENT EXPERIENCE (Core Value + Teacher Feature)

**[ON SCREEN: Switch to student phone view - EchoDeed feed]**

"Here's the magic: Students share acts of kindness completely anonymously. No names, no photos, just authentic moments."

**[Show feed scrolling with real posts]**

"'Helped my friend study for their math test.' 'Invited the new kid to sit with us at lunch.' These are REAL posts from Eastern Guilford students."

**[CRITICAL MOMENT - NEW TEACHER APPRECIATION FEATURE]**

"But here's what makes this different—and this is NEW—when students post their kindness, they can thank the teacher who inspired it."

**[ON SCREEN: Show student selecting teacher, typing appreciation message]**

**Read example:** 
> "Ms. Wilson - Thank you for helping me understand fractions yesterday. You inspired me to help my friend today."

**[ON SCREEN: Show teacher's private dashboard with appreciation messages]**

"Teachers see these private messages. Principals, imagine your teachers getting thanked by students **every single day** for the difference they make. That's retention. That's morale. That's culture."

---

## [1:30-2:30] PARENT CONNECTION (The Differentiator)

**[ON SCREEN: Parent phone notification]**

"Now here's where EchoDeed becomes truly transformative for **family engagement**."

"When a student posts an act of kindness, their parent gets a notification: 'Your teen just shared an act of kindness at school today.'"

**[ON SCREEN: Show parent dashboard with their teen's kindness posts]**

"No other platform does this. Most programs reward the student. We reward BOTH the student AND the parent."

**[Show dual reward system graphic]**

"Why? Because we're not just building better students. We're strengthening families. Imagine a parent at dinner saying, 'I saw you helped someone today. Tell me about it.'"

"That's a positive conversation about school. That changes everything for attendance, for belonging, for family connection."

## [2:30-3:45] ADMINISTRATOR BENEFITS (The Close)

**[ON SCREEN: Switch to Administrator Dashboard]**

"Alright, let's talk about YOUR day-to-day. Three things you care about:"

### 1. Compliance (Automated)
**[Show compliance dashboard]**

"Every single post is automatically logged with timestamps, categories, and behavioral data. When the state asks for your character education documentation, you click 'Export Report.' Done. **90% reduction in compliance paperwork.**"

### 2. Real-Time Climate Data
**[Show behavioral climate graphs]**

"You get real-time insights into school climate. Are students posting about inclusion? About helping others? You see trends **before** they become problems."

**[Show AI safety filter]**

"And yes, we have AI-powered safety monitoring. Flagged content goes straight to your human review queue. Privacy-first design, FERPA compliant."

### 3. Cost Comparison
**[ON SCREEN: Comparison chart]**

"Let's talk money. Character Strong: $8,000-$12,000 per year. Panorama SEL: $10,000-$15,000 per year."

**[Reveal EchoDeed pricing]**

"EchoDeed pilot: **$2,000-$3,000 per year.** That's 75-80% savings for a solution that actually engages students AND parents."
