## [0:00-0:45] THE PROBLEM & HOOK
*[You're visible on camera, platform in background or split-screen]*

"Let me ask you something: How many hours did your team spend last month documenting character education compliance for the state?

Most principals tell us 15 to 20 hours per month. That's nearly 250 hours per year on paperwork alone.

What if I told you EchoDeed reduces that by **90 percent** while actually improving student belonging and attendance? And it costs 75 to 80 percent less than traditional character education programs like Character Strong or Panorama.

I'm Tavores Vanhook, and in the next 5 minutes, I'll show you how Eastern Guilford High School transformed their school culture with a platform that makes character education effortless, measurable, and real.

Let me show you exactly how this works."

## [0:45-1:45] STUDENT EXPERIENCE (Core Value)
*[Navigate to main feed, scroll slowly through posts]*

"This is what students see when they open EchoDeed. A real-time feed of kindness happening at their school. Notice something important here—**no names, no photos, completely anonymous.**

*[Point to specific posts while scrolling]*

'Helped my friend study for their math test.' 'Invited the new kid to sit with us at lunch.' These are REAL posts from Eastern Guilford students. Students share authentically because there's no social pressure, no likes to chase—just real acts of kindness.

*[Click 'Share Kindness' button - opens modal]*

Now watch how easy this is for a student to participate.

*[Begin typing in the main kindness field]*

I'm typing a simple act of kindness: 'Stayed after school to help set up for the basketball game.'

*[Select category]*

Choose a category—let's say 'Community Action.'

*[NOW THE TEACHER APPRECIATION MOMENT - Click teacher dropdown]*

**And here's what makes this transformational for your school culture.**

*[Click the teacher search field, start typing]*

Students can search for and thank a teacher who inspired their kindness. Watch this—I'm typing 'Wil'—

*[Teacher search filters to Wilson]*

—and instantly I see Ms. Wilson.

*[Select teacher, show personal message field appearing]*

Now watch what happens. A personal message field appears where students can write a private note of appreciation to that teacher.

*[Start typing appreciation message]*

'Ms. Wilson - Thanks for helping me understand fractions yesterday. You inspired me to help my friend today.'

*[Pause, look at camera]*

Principals, imagine your teachers getting messages like this **every single day** from students. That's teacher retention. That's morale. That's the culture you've been trying to build.

*[Click submit - watch post appear in feed]*

Submitted. And just like that, this kindness act is documented, the teacher gets their appreciation message privately, and—

*[Point to global counter if visible]*

—the school's global kindness counter just went up.

**Now let me show you what Ms. Wilson sees.**

*[Navigate to sidebar, click Teacher Dashboard tab]*

This is the Teacher Dashboard—where teachers log in to see all the appreciation messages from students.

*[Scroll through Teacher Kudos Feed]*

Look at this. Each card shows the student's kindness act and the personal message they wrote for this teacher. 'Thanks for believing in our team.' 'You inspired me to help my friend today.'

*[Point to metrics at top if visible]*

Teachers see how many times they've been thanked, which categories of kindness they're inspiring. This isn't just feel-good data—this is teacher retention strategy built into your character education program.

When teachers feel valued every single day by students, they stay. They engage. Your culture transforms."

## [2:15-3:00] PARENT CONNECTION (The Differentiator)
*[Navigate to Student Dashboard - show parent notification section]*

"Now here's where EchoDeed becomes truly transformative for family engagement.

*[Point to parent notification indicator or explain]*

When a student shares an act of kindness, their parent gets a notification: 'Your teen just shared an act of kindness at school today.'

*[Navigate to show parent view if possible, or explain while on student view]*

The parent can log in and see what their student shared—not in a creepy surveillance way, but in a 'I'm proud of you' way.

And here's the key: We don't just reward the student. We reward BOTH the student AND the parent.

*[Show token/reward balance]*

See these Echo tokens? Students earn them for acts of kindness. But their parents earn rewards too—discounts from local Greensboro businesses like Chick-fil-A, Greensboro Science Center, Red Cinemas.

Why? Because imagine a parent at dinner saying, 'I saw you helped someone today at school. Tell me about it.' That's a positive conversation about school. That changes attendance. That strengthens families. No other character education platform does this."

## [3:00-4:00] ADMINISTRATOR BENEFITS (The Close)
*[Navigate to Schools Dashboard or Admin view if available, or explain while showing student view]*

"Alright, let's talk about what YOU care about as an administrator. Three things:

**First: Compliance.**

*[If showing admin dashboard, point to compliance features; if not, explain clearly]*

Every single post you just saw is automatically logged with timestamps, categories, student IDs, and behavioral data. When the state asks for your character education documentation, you click 'Export Report.' Done. **90 percent reduction in compliance paperwork.**

**Second: Real-time climate data.**

*[Point to analytics or explain]*

You get real-time insights into school climate. Are students posting about inclusion? About helping others? You see trends before they become problems. And yes, we have AI-powered safety monitoring—flagged content goes straight to your human review queue. Privacy-first design, FERPA compliant.

**Third: Cost.**

Character Strong costs $8,000 to $12,000 per year. Panorama SEL costs $10,000 to $15,000 per year.

EchoDeed pilot pricing: $2,000 to $3,000 per year. That's 75 to 80 percent savings for a solution that actually engages students AND parents."
