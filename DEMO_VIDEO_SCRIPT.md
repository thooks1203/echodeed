**YOU SAY:**  
"The Feed tab is where students see the global kindness counter—287,435 anonymous acts from students across the platform. Complete anonymity means no profiles, no followers, no performative social media behavior. Students can scroll through anonymous posts, give hearts to acts that inspire them, and post their own kindness without anyone knowing who shared it."

"Real posts from real students—but nobody knows who posted what. This removes social pressure and lets authentic empathy shine."

### Rewards Tab - Local Partners (1:45-2:00)
[Click: "Rewards" tab (🎁 icon in bottom navigation)]

## 🎯 CLOSING & CALL TO ACTION (4:55-6:00)

[Screen: Back to teacher Service Hours tab showing pending approvals]

**YOU SAY:**  
"Dr. Harris, here's why I believe EchoDeed is perfect for Eastern Guilford High School:

**For Your 1,200 Students:**  
Complete anonymity removes social pressure and performative behavior. Real local rewards from businesses they actually visit—Chick-fil-A Burlington Road, Cook Out, Greensboro Science Center. Community service tracking with photo verification makes volunteering seamless. Character education becomes intrinsic motivation, not forced compliance.

**For Your Teachers:**  
95% time savings on service hour verification—from 15 minutes to 30 seconds per student. That's over 14 minutes per student given back for actual teaching. One-click CSV export for Guilford County's x2vol requirements. Real-time classroom metrics without extra paperwork. Fewer behavioral issues when kindness becomes the cultural norm.

**For You as Principal:**  
Measurable culture shift you can track—documented acts of kindness, real-time engagement metrics, reduced behavioral incidents. Complete FERPA compliance with no crisis intervention liability. Community partnerships with 21 local businesses showing Eastern Guilford's positive impact. And best of all? Zero cost to your school budget."

[Screen: Show teacher dashboard overview with all tabs visible]

**YOU SAY:**  
"I know you're already doing incredible character education work at Eastern Guilford. EchoDeed doesn't replace what's working—it amplifies it while giving your staff their time back.

I'd like to propose a pilot program:
- Start with one grade level or Ms. Jones's classes
- 30-day trial to test student engagement and teacher time savings
- Full training and support included
- Measure behavioral incidents, service hour submissions, and teacher satisfaction

If it doesn't reduce teacher workload by at least 90% while increasing student engagement, we part as friends. But I'm confident Eastern Guilford students will love the anonymity and rewards, your teachers will love getting their time back, and you'll love having measurable data to show the school board."

[Screen: www.echodeed.com]

**YOU SAY:**  
"Dr. Harris, Eastern Guilford is known for character excellence under your leadership. Let's prove together that character education can reduce teacher workload while improving student behavior and school culture.

I'd love to discuss a pilot program for Eastern Guilford. Thank you for your time today."
