**YOU SAY:**  
"Hi, I'm [Your Name]. Today I want to show you EchoDeed™—the anonymous kindness platform that's solving the biggest problem in character education: teacher burnout from manual verification while actually getting students to care about kindness.

Unlike traditional programs that add to your staff's workload, EchoDeed™ reduces verification time by 95% while engaging students through anonymity and local rewards. We're live at Eastern Guilford High School with Principal of the Year Dr. Darrell Harris. Let me show you how it works."

**YOU SAY:**  
"The first thing Sofia sees is her impact dashboard. She has 1,103 Echo Tokens earned from spreading kindness, a 4-day streak, and 7.5 verified service hours. But here's what makes this different—everything is anonymous. No profiles. No followers. Just pure character in action."

[Point to Echo Tokens balance]

**YOU SAY:**  
"Those tokens? Redeemable at 21 real local businesses—Chick-fil-A Burlington Road, Greensboro Science Center, Cook Out. Students earn real rewards for real kindness."

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### For Maximum Impact:
1. **Lead with pain:** Start by acknowledging teacher overwhelm (they feel seen)
2. **Show, don't tell:** Demonstrate the 30-second verification vs. explaining it
3. **Use real data:** "287,000 acts" sounds more credible than "thousands"
4. **Name-drop Dr. Harris:** Principals trust other principals
5. **End with urgency:** "Ready to pilot in your district" creates FOMO

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Talking too fast (you know the app, they don't)
- ❌ Skipping the student view (they need to see why kids care)
- ❌ Forgetting to mention "zero cost" (huge selling point)
- ❌ Making it too long (4:30 max or they'll stop watching)
