## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT

### Storytelling Techniques:
1. **Lead with pain:** "Teachers spend 15 minutes per student on service hour verification" (they feel seen)
2. **Show, don't tell:** Demonstrate the 30-second approval process vs. explaining it
3. **Use specific numbers:** "287,435 acts" sounds more credible than "hundreds of thousands"
4. **Name-drop Dr. Harris early:** Principals trust other principals, especially Principal of the Year
5. **End with urgency:** "Ready to pilot in your district this semester" creates FOMO

### Phrases That Convert:
- ✅ "95% time savings" (quantified benefit)
- ✅ "Zero cost to your school budget" (removes barrier)
- ✅ "One-click district compliance" (solves pain point)
- ✅ "Real local businesses students actually visit" (shows it's real)
- ✅ "Complete FERPA compliance with no liability" (addresses legal fears)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ **Talking too fast** (you know the app, they don't—slow down!)
- ❌ **Skipping student view** (they need to see why kids actually care)
- ❌ **Forgetting "zero cost"** (huge selling point for budget-strapped schools)
- ❌ **Making it too long** (4:30 max or principals stop watching)
- ❌ **Using jargon** ("UI/UX", "gamification"—use plain language)

### What Principals Care About Most:
1. **Teacher workload reduction** (burnout is epidemic)
2. **Measurable culture metrics** (board wants data)
3. **Zero budget impact** (they're always cutting costs)
4. **Legal compliance** (FERPA, COPPA nightmares keep them awake)
5. **Student engagement** (not participation, genuine buy-in)
