## IV. Real-Time Behavioral Climate Monitoring

### A. Inclusion Score Metrics
**School-Wide Belonging Index (Updated Daily)**

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Inclusion Score = (
  Participation Rate × 0.30 +
  Cross-Group Interactions × 0.25 +
  Positive Sentiment Ratio × 0.20 +
  Conflict Resolution Index × 0.15 +
  Attendance Correlation × 0.10
) × 100
```

**Benchmark Interpretation**:
- **90-100**: Exceptional school climate, high sense of belonging
- **75-89**: Healthy climate, minor improvement opportunities
- **60-74**: Moderate climate, targeted interventions recommended
- **Below 60**: Climate concerns, comprehensive review needed

### B. Three-Layer AI Behavioral Mitigation Architecture
**Legal Compliance Focus (FERPA, Title IX, Dignity Act)**

#### Layer 1: Behavioral Pattern Analyzer
- **Content Classification**: Profanity filter, negative keyword detection (bullying, self-harm, substance abuse)
- **Length Validation**: 10-280 character limits prevent spam/harassment
- **Sentiment Analysis**: OpenAI API integration for context-aware flagging
- **No Automatic Actions**: All flagged content routed to human review

#### Layer 2: Compliance Filter (Pre-Posting)
- **Real-Time Moderation**: Posts scanned before publication
- **Human Moderation Queue**: Teachers/counselors review flagged content within 24 hours
- **Documentation Trail**: All moderation decisions logged for compliance audits
- **No Crisis Interventions**: System does NOT automatically contact parents/authorities (liability protection)

#### Layer 3: Aggregate Climate Monitor
- **School-Wide Trend Analytics**: Weekly/monthly sentiment dashboards
- **Early Warning Indicators**: Sudden drops in positive posting rates, increases in flagged content
- **Anonymous Reporting**: Students can flag concerning posts without revealing identity
- **Principal Reports**: Automated weekly behavioral climate summaries

### C. Teacher Moderation Dashboard
**Human-Centered Compliance Workflow**
- **Flagged Content Queue**: Review posts, approve/reject/escalate decisions
- **Student Context Panel**: View flagging student's history, previous reports
- **Commenting System**: Document rationale for moderation decisions
- **CSV Export**: Generate compliance reports for district audits
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Only authorized staff access moderation tools
