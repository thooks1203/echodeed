## The Problem
Schools struggle to build character culture, measure outcomes, and create belonging - all while managing administrative burden.

## The Solution
**EchoDeed™** is a mobile-first platform where students share anonymous acts of kindness, earn tokens, and redeem real rewards from local businesses.
