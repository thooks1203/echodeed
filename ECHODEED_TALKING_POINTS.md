# EchoDeed™ Demo Talking Points
## For Eastern Guilford Middle School - Principal McNeil

## Opening Hook (30 seconds)

> "What if I told you that you could measure your school's sense of belonging in real-time, reward students for being kind, AND reduce your character education paperwork - all with one platform?"

---

## The 30-Second Pitch

> "EchoDeed is where kindness becomes currency. Students anonymously share good deeds, earn tokens, and redeem them for real rewards from places like Chick-fil-A. Meanwhile, YOU get real-time data on how supported your students feel. It's character education that kids actually WANT to do."

## Objection Handlers

### "We already do character education"
> "Great! EchoDeed amplifies what you're doing. It makes the invisible kindness in your building visible and measurable. Plus, students actually WANT to participate because of real rewards."

### "Students might abuse the system"
> "Everything is AI-moderated. Inappropriate content is automatically flagged for human review. Anonymous posting actually reduces showing off - students share kindness, not seeking attention."

### "We don't have time to implement something new"
> "Implementation takes just 1-2 weeks. Teachers get pre-built tools that REDUCE their workload. You'll actually save time on character education compliance."

### "How is this different from PBIS?"
> "EchoDeed complements PBIS. PBIS focuses on behavior management; EchoDeed focuses on character growth and community building. The data integrates beautifully."

### "What about student privacy?"
> "We're fully FERPA compliant. Kindness posts are anonymous. Pulse check responses are anonymous. We never share individual student data externally."
