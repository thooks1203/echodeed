Hi [Head of School Name],

I was reading about Heathwood Hall's commitment to Episcopal education 
and noticed you have 14 Teachers of the Year on staff - that's 
extraordinary.

I'm Tavores Vanhook, founder of EchoDeed - a character education 
platform designed specifically for mission-driven schools like yours. 
I'm reaching out because EchoDeed helps students practice dignity and 
belonging through anonymous acts of kindness.

Here's how it works:

When a student helps someone (tutoring a classmate, holding the door, 
encouraging a friend), they share it anonymously on the platform - no 
names, no photos, no social media glory.

Why anonymity matters for Episcopal values:
• Dignity: Everyone's kindness matters equally (no popularity contest)
• Belonging: "We are a kind community" (not "I need recognition")
• Humility: Virtue practiced when no one is watching

The result? Students develop authentic character (not performative 
virtue for Instagram).

**Bonus for your team:**

✅ Parents get real-time notifications: "Your teen did something kind 
   today" → Positive dinner conversations
✅ Teachers receive daily appreciation messages from students → 
   Retention support (keeps your 14 Teachers of Year!)
✅ Automated compliance documentation → 90% paperwork reduction for 
   character education requirements

I wrote a white paper specifically for Episcopal schools titled 
"Episcopal Values + Anonymous Kindness: A Natural Fit" that shows how 
this operationalizes what you're already teaching.

Would you be open to a 5-minute demo? I can walk you through:
1. How students post anonymously
2. What parent notifications look like
3. The compliance dashboard (one-click reporting)

Best,
Tavores Vanhook
Founder, EchoDeed

P.S. We're significantly more affordable than Character Strong or 
Panorama, and we actually engage parents and teachers (they don't).
