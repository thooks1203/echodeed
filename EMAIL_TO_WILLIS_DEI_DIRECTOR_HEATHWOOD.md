Hi Willis,

I came across your work on multicultural initiatives and diversity 
leadership at Heathwood Hall - particularly your role in developing 
the PAIS Inclusivity Conference. Impressive work.

I'm Tavores Vanhook, founder of EchoDeed - a belonging and dignity 
platform for schools. I'm reaching out because I built something that 
might align with your DEI mission: a platform where students practice 
belonging and dignity through anonymous acts of kindness.

Here's why anonymity matters for DEI:

When students share kindness WITHOUT names or photos, it creates 
equity of recognition. The quiet kid who tutored someone gets the 
same visibility as the popular student council president. No 
popularity contests. Just authentic kindness.

The result:
• Students from all backgrounds feel equally valued (belonging)
• Recognition is based on character, not social status (equity)
• Students practice humility and service without seeking glory 
  (dignity)

**Why this might resonate with your students:**

Given your 25+ years in community service and counseling, you've 
probably seen this: students who do incredible acts of kindness but 
never get recognized because they're not the "popular kids."

EchoDeed flips that. Every act of kindness - regardless of who did 
it - gets equal visibility. The school sees a feed of kindness, but 
it's anonymous. Students practice virtue without seeking recognition.

Bonus: Parents get real-time notifications when their teen does 
something kind. For families from diverse backgrounds, this creates 
positive dinner conversations that might not otherwise happen.

I wrote a white paper on Episcopal values + anonymous kindness that 
shows how this operationalizes dignity and belonging (happy to share 
if it's helpful).

Given your work on inclusivity and multicultural initiatives, I'm 
curious: would this resonate with Heathwood's student culture?

Worth a quick 5-minute conversation?

Best,
Tavores Vanhook
Founder, EchoDeed

P.S. Your daughter Lydia's a Heathwood alum ('09) - I bet she saw 
some incredible acts of kindness during her time there. This platform 
makes sure those moments get celebrated, even when students don't 
seek the spotlight.

## 🎯 WHY THIS EMAIL WORKS FOR WILLIS

### **Strategic Framing:**

**Different from Head of School email:**
- ✅ **DEI language** (belonging, dignity, equity) not just "character education"
- ✅ **Personal connection** (his 25+ years experience, his daughter)
- ✅ **Aligns with his actual job** (multicultural initiatives, inclusivity)
- ✅ **Consultative tone** ("I'm curious... would this resonate?")

### **Positioning:**

**For Head of School:** Business case (cost savings, compliance, ROI)  
**For Willis:** Mission alignment (DEI, belonging, equity)

**Result:** Two different entry points to same school = higher success rate

## 🎯 WHAT CHANGED (Added Introduction)

**Line 3:**
```
I'm Tavores Vanhook, founder of EchoDeed - a belonging and dignity 
platform for schools.
```

**Why this specific wording for Willis:**
- ✅ "Belonging and dignity platform" (DEI language, not "character ed")
- ✅ Aligns with his title (Director of DEI)
- ✅ Positions EchoDeed as DEI tool (broader than just character education)

## 📊 SENDING STRATEGY: BOTH EMAILS SAME DAY

### **Timeline:**

**Today:**
