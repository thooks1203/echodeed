# Email Tracking Setup Guide
**Track opens, clicks, and responses for your EchoDeed school outreach**

---

## 🎯 Why Track Emails?

**You need to know:**
- ✅ Which schools opened your email (shows interest)
- ✅ Which schools clicked your demo link (high intent)
- ✅ Which email versions perform best (optimize future sends)
- ✅ When to follow up (timing matters)

**Without tracking:** You're flying blind, guessing who's interested

**With tracking:** You know exactly who to prioritize for follow-up

## 📊 **Manual Tracking (No Tools Required)**

**If you don't want to use tracking tools**, use your CRM spreadsheet manually:

### **Daily Routine (10 min/day):**

1. **Check Gmail** for responses
2. **Update spreadsheet:**
   - "Response Status" column: No Response / Opened (guessed) / Replied / Scheduled Demo
   - "Response Date" column: Date of reply
   - "Notes" column: Key details from response

3. **Log actions:**
   - "Follow-up 1 Sent" column: Date
   - "Lead Magnet Sent" column: Which one

**Pros:** No tech required, full control  
**Cons:** Can't see opens/clicks, time-consuming, easy to forget updates

---

## 🔗 **Link Tracking (Works with All Options)**

**To track which schools click your demo link:**

### **Use Bitly (Free)**

1. **Create Bitly Account**
   - Go to https://bitly.com/
   - Sign up free

2. **Shorten Your Demo Link**
   - Paste: `https://calendly.com/tavores-echodeed/demo` (or whatever you use)
   - Bitly creates: `https://bit.ly/echodeed-demo`
   - Track clicks in Bitly dashboard

3. **Create Unique Links Per School (Advanced)**
   - `https://bit.ly/echodeed-demo-trinity`
   - `https://bit.ly/echodeed-demo-heathwood`
   - See which schools clicked (even if they don't reply)

**What you learn:**
- ✅ Which schools clicked demo link (high intent)
- ✅ When they clicked (follow up immediately)
- ✅ How many times they clicked (passed to colleagues?)

## 📧 **Email Template with Tracking Links**

### **Example: Heathwood Hall Email with Bitly Tracking**

```
Subject: "Unique worth and beauty of all human beings" - I built a platform that honors this

Hi [Head of School Name],

Heathwood Hall's commitment to "model God's love and grace with 
commitment to the unique worth and beauty of all human beings" is 
exactly why I built EchoDeed.

[... rest of email ...]

Want a 5-minute demo?
👉 Schedule here: https://bit.ly/echodeed-demo-heathwood

Or download this white paper I wrote for Episcopal schools:
👉 Episcopal Values + Anonymous Kindness: https://bit.ly/echodeed-episcopal

Best,
Tavores
336-214-1645
tavores@echodeed.com
```

**Bitly tracks:**
- Did they click demo link? (ready to schedule)
- Did they click white paper? (researching, need follow-up)
- Neither? (not interested or too busy)

## 🎯 **Weekly CRM Review Routine**

### **Every Monday Morning (30 min):**

1. **Filter by Response Status:**
   - **"No Response"** → Send Follow-up 1 (after 3-4 days)
   - **"Opened but No Reply"** → Send lead magnet + gentle nudge
   - **"Replied - Interested"** → Schedule demo ASAP
   - **"Demo Scheduled"** → Prep demo (review school's website, customize talking points)

2. **Update Priorities:**
   - Sort by "Tier" (Tier 1 = highest priority)
   - Focus on Tier 1 schools first
   - Move responsive schools up in priority

3. **Analyze Patterns:**
   - Which email versions get best response rate?
   - Which schools opened but didn't reply? (Need different approach)
   - Which schools clicked demo link but didn't schedule? (Fear of commitment - need reassurance)

## 📞 **Response Tracking Shortcuts**

### **Gmail Labels (Free, Simple)**

Create labels:
- 🟢 **EchoDeed - Demo Scheduled**
- 🟡 **EchoDeed - Interested, No Demo Yet**
- 🔴 **EchoDeed - Not Interested**
- ⚪ **EchoDeed - No Response**

As schools reply, drag emails into labels. Quick visual of pipeline.

## 🎁 **Lead Magnet Tracking**

**For each lead magnet PDF, create unique Bitly link:**

- "Paperwork Framework" → `https://bit.ly/echodeed-paperwork`
- "5 Questions" → `https://bit.ly/echodeed-5questions`
- "Episcopal Values" → `https://bit.ly/echodeed-episcopal`
- "Parent Notifications" → `https://bit.ly/echodeed-parents`

**Track downloads in Bitly:**
- Who downloaded what?
- Follow up with relevant demo angle
