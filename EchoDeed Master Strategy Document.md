## Investor Q&A

### Common Investor Questions & Responses

**Q: What makes your AI prediction more accurate than existing solutions?**
A: Our patent-pending algorithms specifically focus on burnout prediction using anonymous behavioral patterns. Unlike general engagement surveys, we analyze real-time workplace interactions, communication patterns, and sentiment changes to achieve 85% accuracy in 2-8 week predictions. No existing solution combines this level of prediction accuracy with complete anonymity.

**Q: How do you maintain anonymity while providing useful organizational insights?**
A: Our proprietary aggregation algorithms ensure individual data cannot be reverse-engineered while providing department and team-level insights. We use differential privacy techniques and minimum group sizes to protect individual identity. This is covered by our provisional patent for anonymous organizational analytics.

**Q: What's your customer acquisition cost and how does it scale?**
A: Current projected CAC is $100K in Year 1, improving to $65K by Year 3 as we build brand recognition and channel partnerships. Enterprise deals average $250K annually with 3+ year contracts, giving us an 8.8:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Channel partnerships will reduce direct acquisition costs while expanding market reach.

**Q: How defensible is your competitive position?**
A: We have multiple defensive moats: (1) Patent protection on core algorithms, (2) Network effects from data aggregation, (3) High switching costs for enterprise customers, (4) Integration depth with HR systems, (5) Compliance certifications that take months to achieve. First-mover advantage in AI-powered predictive wellness gives us 18-24 month head start.

**Q: What's your path to $100M+ revenue?**
A: Our model shows clear path: $1.2M Year 1 → $7.6M Year 2 → $30M Year 3. Beyond that, international expansion, new product lines (diversity analytics, performance prediction), and potential acquisition of complementary technologies can drive to $100M+. Market size supports much larger scale.

**Q: How do you compete with free solutions or internal HR tools?**
A: ROI justification is compelling - preventing 1-2 burnout cases per 1000 employees pays for the entire platform. Our AI prediction capabilities are impossible to replicate internally, and the anonymous insights provide data that traditional HR tools cannot capture. We're not competing on price but on unique value.

**Q: What happens if a major player like Microsoft or Oracle builds competing features?**
A: Patent protection provides legal barriers. Technical complexity of our algorithms requires significant AI expertise. Most importantly, enterprise customers value specialized solutions over feature additions to existing platforms. We're positioned for acquisition rather than direct competition.

**Q: How quickly can you scale to enterprise requirements?**
A: Our infrastructure currently supports 75K concurrent users with auto-scaling to 100K+. Enterprise features like SSO, custom integrations, and compliance certifications are prioritized in our roadmap. We're designed for enterprise from day one, not scaling up from consumer.

**Q: What's your international expansion strategy?**
A: GDPR compliance is built-in for European expansion. English-speaking markets (UK, Canada, Australia) are natural first targets. Data localization and cultural adaptation of AI models will be required for other regions. Partnership strategy will accelerate international growth.

**Q: How do you handle the sensitivity of mental health data?**
A: We never collect personal mental health information. Our system analyzes workplace behavior patterns (communication frequency, sentiment, participation) to predict risk, not diagnose conditions. This approach avoids medical data regulations while providing actionable insights for intervention.
