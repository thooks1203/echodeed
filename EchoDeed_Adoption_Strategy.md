# EchoDeed™ User Adoption Strategy
*Overcoming the #1 Reason EdTech and HR Tech Fails*

---

## **THE ADOPTION CRISIS IN EDUCATION & CORPORATE TECH**

### **Sobering Statistics:**
- **70% of EdTech implementations fail** due to poor user adoption
- **65% of corporate wellness programs** have <30% participation rates
- **Average teacher uses only 3-5 apps** regularly despite having access to 20+
- **Students abandon platforms** if not engaged within first 2 weeks

### **Root Causes of Failure:**
❌ Assuming "if you build it, they will come"  
❌ Focusing on features instead of habit formation  
❌ Inadequate training and onboarding  
❌ No incentive structure for early adopters  
❌ Poor integration with existing workflows
