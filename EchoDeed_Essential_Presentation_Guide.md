## 📋 **OBJECTION HANDLING**

### **"Too expensive for our school budget"**
**Response:** "At $3,500, we replace $15,000+ worth of separate tools. You're getting character education, safety monitoring, parent engagement, and crisis prevention in one platform. That's 83% cost savings."

### **"Parents won't adopt another app"**
**Response:** "Parents don't just use this app - they get rewarded for using it. When they earn a $5 Starbucks card because their child was kind, adoption becomes automatic. Our pilots show 85% parent adoption vs. 23% for traditional programs."

### **"AI monitoring makes us nervous"**
**Response:** "Our AI only identifies risk patterns - it never stores personal information. Everything is anonymous, and teachers make all final decisions. We're COPPA and FERPA compliant, and parents have full transparency and control."

### **"Sounds too good to be true"**
**Response:** "That's exactly why we offer pilot programs. Let us prove the results with your students and families before you commit. Our early schools see measurable improvements in 90 days."
