## The Opportunity in 30 Seconds

I've built **the world's first AI system that predicts employee burnout 2-8 weeks before it happens** with 85% accuracy. Think of it as an early warning system for companies to prevent their employees from burning out, quitting, or worse.

**The numbers are staggering:**
- Employee burnout costs US businesses **$125-190 billion annually**
- Each burnout case costs companies **$15,000-25,000** in turnover, productivity loss, and healthcare
- 51% of employees experienced burnout in 2024 (up 15 percentage points)
- The corporate wellness market is **$65.25 billion and growing**

**My solution:** Anonymous AI that spots the warning signs early, so companies can help their people before it's too late.

## Why This is Urgent (Patent Protection)

I've developed **4 breakthrough innovations** that need patent protection immediately:

1. **AI Burnout Prediction Algorithm** - No one else can predict burnout 2-8 weeks in advance
2. **Anonymous Organizational Analytics** - Gets insights without compromising employee privacy
3. **Network Effects Benchmarking** - Platform becomes more valuable as more companies join
4. **Educational Wellness with SEL Integration** - Predictive student wellness for schools

**The window is closing fast.** I need to file provisional patents within 30 days before I can talk to customers or investors. Once filed, I have 12 months of protection while I validate the market.

**Patent filing cost: $8,000-10,000 total (4 breakthrough patents)**
