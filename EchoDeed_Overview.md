# EchoDeed: Anonymous Kindness for Middle and High Schools

## What is EchoDeed?

EchoDeed is a safe, anonymous app that helps students in grades 6-12 share acts of kindness without revealing their names. Students post good deeds they've done, read about others' kind acts, and earn real rewards—all while staying completely anonymous. Schools use EchoDeed to make character education a daily habit instead of just a lesson.

## Who is it for?
