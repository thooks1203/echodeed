## 📧 EMAIL DRAFT

**To:** [Head of School Name], Heathwood Hall Episcopal School  
**From:** Tavores Vanhook (tavores@echodeed.com)  
**Subject:** Episcopal values + daily student gratitude = belonging that lasts

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

I was reading about Heathwood Hall's commitment to Episcopal education 
and noticed you have 14 Teachers of the Year on staff - that's 
extraordinary.

I'm reaching out because I built something specifically for Episcopal 
schools like yours: a platform where students practice dignity and 
belonging through anonymous acts of kindness.

Here's how it works:

When a student helps someone (tutoring a classmate, holding the door, 
encouraging a friend), they share it anonymously - no names, no photos, 
no social media glory.

Why anonymity matters for Episcopal values:
• Dignity: Everyone's kindness matters equally (no popularity contest)
• Belonging: "We are a kind community" (not "I need recognition")
• Humility: Virtue practiced when no one is watching

The result? Students develop authentic character (not performative 
virtue for Instagram).

**Bonus for your team:**

✅ Parents get real-time notifications: "Your teen did something kind 
   today" → Positive dinner conversations
✅ Teachers receive daily appreciation messages from students → 
   Retention support (keeps your 14 Teachers of Year!)
✅ Automated compliance documentation → 90% paperwork reduction for 
   character education requirements

I wrote a white paper specifically for Episcopal schools titled 
"Episcopal Values + Anonymous Kindness: A Natural Fit" that shows how 
this operationalizes what you're already teaching.

Would you be open to a 5-minute demo? I can walk you through:
1. How students post anonymously
2. What parent notifications look like
3. The compliance dashboard (one-click reporting)

Best,
Tavores Vanhook

P.S. We're significantly more affordable than Character Strong or 
Panorama, and we actually engage parents and teachers (they don't).

## 📞 FOLLOW-UP EMAIL (If No Reply in 3 Days)

**Subject:** Quick question about Heathwood's character education

```
Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up on my email from [Date].

I know Episcopal schools face unique challenges: you need to honor 
your theological mission WHILE meeting state character education 
requirements.

Most platforms (Character Strong, Panorama) are built for public 
schools and don't align with Episcopal values.

EchoDeed is different: anonymity teaches humility, belonging builds 
community, and parent engagement creates positive family interactions.

Plus, you save $4,500/year vs. Character Strong while getting features 
they don't offer.

Worth a 5-minute look?

Best,
Tavores
