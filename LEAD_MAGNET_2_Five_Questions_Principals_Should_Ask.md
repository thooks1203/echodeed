# 5 Questions Every Principal Should Ask Their Character Education Vendor
**Use this checklist to evaluate your current program (or any new proposal)**

---

## Why These Questions Matter

Most schools invest $8,000-$15,000 annually in character education programs like Character Strong, Panorama SEL, or Second Step. But when accreditation time comes, you're scrambling to prove it actually worked.

These 5 questions help you evaluate whether your character education program delivers **real evidence of impact** or just **expensive curriculum binders**.

---

## Question 1: "Can you show me evidence that students are PRACTICING these values, not just hearing about them?"

### **What Most Vendors Say:**
"Our curriculum includes 32 lessons on empathy, respect, and responsibility."

### **What That Actually Means:**
You can prove you *taught* character education. You **cannot** prove students practiced it.

### **The Better Answer:**
"Yes, here's a report showing 847 documented acts of kindness from students this semester, categorized by value (helping others, inclusion, gratitude, service). Each one is timestamped and includes the student's own description of what they did."

---

### **✅ Evaluation Checklist:**

Does your program provide:
- [ ] Real examples of student behavior (not just lesson completion records)
- [ ] Timestamped evidence of character education practice
- [ ] Student voices (quotes, descriptions of acts) not just teacher observations
- [ ] Proof that goes beyond "we taught the lesson"

**Red Flag:** If your vendor's evidence is "We have 32 lesson plans and teacher guides," you're paying for curriculum, not documentation of student growth.

---

## Question 2: "How much time does it take my staff to document compliance for the state or accreditation?"

### **What Most Vendors Say:**
"Our program includes assessment rubrics and reporting templates."

### **What That Actually Means:**
Your admin team still manually compiles data, writes narrative reports, and spends 15-20 hours per month organizing documentation.

### **The Better Answer:**
"Your compliance reports auto-generate from student activity data. Click 'Export Report,' and you get a comprehensive summary with charts, participation rates, and real-world examples. Total time: 2 minutes."

---

### **✅ Evaluation Checklist:**

Ask your current vendor:
- [ ] How many staff hours per month does compliance documentation require?
- [ ] Can reports be generated instantly, or does someone have to compile data manually?
- [ ] Is data stored in one place, or scattered across binders, spreadsheets, and teacher emails?
- [ ] Can you export evidence for accreditation visits without recreating it from memory?

**Red Flag:** If compliance documentation takes more than 5 hours per month, you're overpaying for manual busywork.

---

## Question 3: "Does this program engage parents, or just students?"

### **What Most Vendors Say:**
"Parents can access our family resources portal."

### **What That Actually Means:**
There's a password-protected PDF library parents never visit. Zero family engagement.

### **The Better Answer:**
"When a student shares an act of kindness, their parent gets a real-time notification: 'Your teen just shared an act of kindness at school today.' Parents can see what their student posted and earn rewards alongside them, creating positive dinner conversations about school."

---

### **✅ Evaluation Checklist:**

Does your program:
- [ ] Notify parents when their student participates (not just quarterly newsletters)
- [ ] Give parents a reason to engage (rewards, recognition, positive reinforcement)
- [ ] Create opportunities for positive parent-teen conversations about school
- [ ] Track parent engagement metrics (open rates, logins, interactions)

**Red Flag:** If "parent engagement" means "we sent them a PDF in August," attendance and family connection won't improve.

---

## Question 4: "How does this program support teacher morale and retention?"

### **What Most Vendors Say:**
"Teachers receive professional development on our curriculum."

### **What That Actually Means:**
Teachers get one more thing to teach, with no recognition or appreciation for the emotional labor of character education.

### **The Better Answer:**
"Students can publicly (or privately) thank teachers who inspired their kindness. Teachers log into a dashboard and see appreciation messages from students every day. This isn't just feel-good fluff - daily recognition improves teacher retention, especially in competitive salary markets."

---

### **✅ Evaluation Checklist:**

Does your program:
- [ ] Recognize teachers for the character education work they already do
- [ ] Provide daily positive reinforcement (not just annual awards)
- [ ] Give students a way to express gratitude to staff
- [ ] Track which teachers are inspiring the most character development (data for retention conversations)

**Red Flag:** If your character education program adds to teacher workload without adding to teacher appreciation, burnout accelerates.

---

## Question 5: "What's the cost per student, and what am I actually paying for?"

### **What Most Vendors Say:**
"Our program costs $8,000-$15,000 per year for curriculum, training, and platform access."

### **What That Actually Means:**
For a school with 500 students, that's $16-$30 per student. You're paying for:
- Lesson plans (which you could get free from SEL resources)
- One-time training (90% of teachers won't remember it)
- Platform access (that tracks lesson completion, not student behavior)

### **The Better Answer:**
"Our program costs $2,000-$3,000 per year for 500 students ($4-$6 per student). You're paying for:
- Automated compliance documentation (saves 200+ hours/year)
- Real-time student behavior tracking (evidence for accreditation)
- Parent engagement system (improves attendance and family connection)
- Teacher appreciation platform (retention support)"

---

### **✅ Evaluation Checklist:**

Ask your vendor:
- [ ] What's the cost per student?
- [ ] Am I paying for curriculum content, or for outcomes (documentation, engagement, retention)?
- [ ] What's included in the annual fee vs. upsells (training, reports, support)?
- [ ] Can I justify this cost to my board with ROI (time saved, parent engagement, teacher retention)?

**Red Flag:** If you're paying $15,000/year but still manually compiling reports, you're overpaying by 500%.

## The Scorecard: How Does Your Current Program Stack Up?

### **Give your current character education program 1 point for each:**

1. ✅ Provides real evidence of student practice (not just curriculum proof)
2. ✅ Auto-generates compliance reports in under 5 minutes
3. ✅ Engages parents with real-time notifications and rewards
4. ✅ Recognizes teachers daily with student appreciation messages
5. ✅ Costs under $10/student while delivering measurable ROI

---

### **Your Score:**

**0-1 Points:** You're paying for curriculum, not outcomes. Consider switching.

**2-3 Points:** You're getting partial value, but leaving money and time on the table.

**4-5 Points:** You've found a rare program that delivers real ROI. (If it's not EchoDeed, we'd love to learn from them!)

---

## What to Do Next

### **If Your Current Program Scored 0-3:**

You have three options:

1. **Keep overpaying** for curriculum binders and manual compliance work (not recommended)

2. **Supplement your current program** with EchoDeed for automated documentation ($2,000-$3,000/year, addresses compliance + parent engagement gaps)

3. **Switch entirely** to EchoDeed and reallocate $5,000-$12,000/year to other priorities (teacher salaries, technology, facilities)

---

## The Bottom Line

**You became a principal to transform lives, not to fill out paperwork.**

Your character education program should:
- Document compliance automatically (not add to your workload)
- Engage families (not just students)
- Appreciate teachers (not burden them)
- Cost less than your copier lease (not $15,000/year)

**If your current program fails these tests, it's time to ask better questions.**
