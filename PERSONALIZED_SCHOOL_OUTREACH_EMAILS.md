#### **EMAIL 1: Trinity School of Durham & Chapel Hill**

**To:** Head of School, Trinity School of Durham & Chapel Hill  
**Subject:** How to retain teachers with 11+ years of experience (without raising salaries)

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

I was impressed reading about Trinity's 11+ years average teacher 
experience - that's extraordinary retention in today's market.

I'm reaching out because I built something specifically for schools 
like yours that value experienced faculty: a platform where students 
can thank teachers daily for inspiring their kindness.

Here's how it works:

When a student shares an act of kindness (like "helped a classmate 
with homework"), they can privately thank the teacher who inspired 
them. Teachers log in and see appreciation messages from students 
every single day.

Not just once a year. Every. Single. Day.

This matters because teacher retention isn't just about salary - it's 
about feeling valued. And daily student gratitude is free.

Bonus: The system auto-documents your character education compliance 
(90% paperwork reduction) and engages parents with real-time 
notifications when their teen does something kind.

Cost: $7,500/year (vs. $8,000-$12,000 for Character Strong)

Early adopter pricing: $6,000 for first 10 schools (locked in forever)

Would you be open to a 5-minute demo showing how this works?

#### **EMAIL 2: St. David's School (Raleigh)**

**To:** Head of School, St. David's School  
**Subject:** Building students who "lead with humility" - character education that actually works

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

I love St. David's "Portrait of a Graduate" framework - especially 
the focus on leading with humility and persevering through challenges.

Most character education programs teach students to SEEK recognition 
for good deeds (the opposite of humility). I built EchoDeed to do 
the opposite:

Students share acts of kindness anonymously - no names, no photos, 
no likes. They practice virtue without public credit.

Why? Because humility is who you are when no one is watching.

Here's what this looks like:

• Student helps a classmate → Posts anonymously → No social media 
  glory, just internal satisfaction
• School's anonymous feed shows collective kindness → Students 
  think "we are a kind community" (not "I need recognition")
• Parents get notified → Positive dinner conversation → Family 
  bonds strengthen

The result: Students develop authentic character (not performative 
virtue), and you get automated compliance documentation for 
accreditation.

Cost: $7,500/year (50% less than Panorama SEL - and does more)

Early adopter pricing: $6,000 for first 10 schools (locked in forever)

Can I show you a 5-minute demo of how anonymous kindness builds 
the humility you're already teaching?

#### **EMAIL 3: Wake Christian Academy (Raleigh)**

**To:** Head of School, Wake Christian Academy  
**Subject:** 50 years of impact + 90% less compliance paperwork = more time for mission

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

Wake Christian's 50+ year mission to "equip students to impact the 
world for Christ" is inspiring. But I'm guessing the state's 
character education compliance requirements don't feel very 
mission-focused.

What if you could:

✅ Document character education automatically as students practice it
✅ Reduce compliance paperwork by 90% (180 hours → 18 hours/year)
✅ Engage 500+ families with real-time "your teen did something kind" 
   notifications
✅ Give teachers daily student appreciation (retention without 
   raising salaries)

That's EchoDeed. Students share acts of kindness anonymously, the 
system timestamps + categorizes everything, and compliance reports 
auto-generate.

One principal told me: "I spent 20 hours last month compiling 
character ed documentation. This would've taken 2 minutes."

Cost: $7,500/year (vs. $8,000-$12,000 for Character Strong)

Early adopter pricing: $6,000 for first 10 schools - lock in this rate forever (increases to $7,500 after)

#### **EMAIL 4: Gaston Christian School**

**To:** Head of School / Director of Student Life  
**Subject:** 800 students × $3.38M scholarships = families who need this

**Email:**

```
Hi [Name],

I saw Gaston Christian awarded $3.38M in scholarships last year - 
that's incredible access for families who otherwise couldn't afford 
Christian education.

Here's why I'm reaching out:

Many of those scholarship families are working multiple jobs. They 
WANT to stay connected to their teen's school life, but don't have 
bandwidth for PTO meetings and volunteer hours.

EchoDeed gives them something better: real-time notifications when 
their teen does something kind at school.

Parent gets text: "Your teen just shared an act of kindness at 
Gaston Christian today. Log in to see what they did and earn 
rewards together."

Suddenly, mom working two shifts gets POSITIVE news from school 
(not just "your kid missed homework"). Dinner conversation shifts 
from "how was school?" (grunt) to "tell me about helping that 
classmate today."

This changes attendance. This changes family engagement. This 
changes how parents feel about your school.

Plus: You get 90% paperwork reduction on character education 
compliance + teacher appreciation built in.

Cost: $7,500/year (less than 2 scholarship awards, impacts 800 
students)

Can I show you the parent notification flow in a 5-minute demo?

#### **EMAIL 5: Heathwood Hall Episcopal School (SC - but NC border)**

**To:** Head of School, Heathwood Hall Episcopal School  
**Subject:** "Unique worth and beauty of all human beings" - I built a platform that honors this

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

Heathwood Hall's commitment to "model God's love and grace with 
commitment to the unique worth and beauty of all human beings" is 
exactly why I built EchoDeed.

Most character education platforms inadvertently create social 
hierarchies - popular students get recognized, quiet students feel 
invisible. This contradicts Episcopal values.

EchoDeed does the opposite:

Every kindness act is shared ANONYMOUSLY - no names, no photos, 
no popularity contests. A freshman's post appears alongside a senior 
class president's. Equal visibility. Inherent worth.

Students share authentically because there's no social pressure. 
Your "Mindful in the Hall" program already teaches self-awareness - 
EchoDeed gives students a safe space to practice it.

Plus:

✅ Parents get real-time "your teen shared kindness" notifications 
   (family engagement)
✅ Teachers receive private appreciation messages from students 
   (retention support - 14 SCISA Teachers of the Year need to feel 
   valued!)
✅ 90% compliance paperwork reduction (auto-documentation)

Cost: $7,500/year (50% less than Panorama SEL - and does more)

Early adopter pricing: $6,000 for first 10 schools (locked in forever)

I wrote a white paper specifically for Episcopal schools about why 
anonymous kindness aligns with Imago Dei theology. Want me to send 
it along with a demo link?

Best,
Tavores Vanhook
336-214-1645
tavores@echodeed.com

P.S. Your school serves 903 students - that's $8.30 per student for 
a platform that operationalizes your Episcopal values.
```

**Why this works:** Theological alignment, references their specific programs (Mindful in the Hall), addresses teacher retention (14 Teachers of Year = need to keep them)

#### **EMAIL 6: Christ School (Asheville)**

**To:** Head of School, Christ School  
**Subject:** All-boys school + character education = unique opportunity

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

All-boys schools face a unique challenge: How do you teach emotional 
intelligence and kindness without it feeling "soft" or uncool?

EchoDeed solves this:

• Anonymous posting removes social pressure (boys don't worry about 
  looking "too nice")
• Gaming elements (streaks, tokens, rewards) make it engaging
• Teacher appreciation feature lets boys express gratitude privately 
  (avoids public vulnerability)

One middle school boy in our demo said: "I wouldn't post on 
Instagram about helping someone, but this is different. It's private."

That's the key: Boys WANT to be kind, but need permission to do it 
without social risk.

Plus: You get automated character education compliance (90% 
paperwork reduction) and data showing which boys are engaging vs. 
who might need support.

Cost: $7,500/year

Can I show you the male student engagement flow in a 5-minute demo?

#### **EMAIL 7: Heritage Leadership Academy**

**To:** Head of School, Heritage Leadership Academy  
**Subject:** University Model + parent partnership = perfect fit for EchoDeed

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

Heritage Leadership's University Model already prioritizes parent 
partnership. EchoDeed amplifies what you're already doing:

Here's the flow:

1. Student shares kindness act at school → System documents it
2. Parent gets real-time notification: "Your teen shared kindness 
   today"
3. Parent AND student earn rewards together (Chick-fil-A, local 
   businesses)
4. Dinner conversation: "Tell me about helping that classmate today"

This creates positive parent-teen conversations about school - the 
exact family engagement you're already committed to.

Plus:

✅ Automated compliance documentation (90% paperwork reduction)
✅ Teachers receive daily student appreciation (morale boost)
✅ Anonymous posting honors every student's "God-given purpose" 
   equally

Cost: $7,500/year

Your parent partnership model is your competitive advantage. Want 
to see how EchoDeed supercharges it?

#### **EMAIL 8: Gramercy Christian School**

**To:** Head of School, Gramercy Christian School  
**Subject:** Discipleship school + mission trips + kindness documentation = natural fit

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

Gramercy's focus on "developing disciples for Jesus Christ" through 
mission trips is inspiring. EchoDeed complements what you're already 
doing:

Mission trips teach students to serve others in dramatic ways 
(building homes, medical care, etc.). EchoDeed documents the 
EVERYDAY acts of discipleship happening between trips:

• Helping a struggling classmate with homework
• Including the new student at lunch
• Thanking a teacher for extra help

These small acts of obedience matter too - and EchoDeed captures 
them automatically.

When accreditation asks "How are you teaching character education?" 
you'll have 500+ timestamped examples of students practicing 
Christ-like behavior.

Plus:

✅ Parents get notified when teens practice kindness (family 
   discipleship)
✅ Teachers receive student appreciation (retention support)
✅ 90% less compliance paperwork

Cost: $7,500/year

Can I show you how this works in a 5-minute demo?

#### **EMAIL 9: Nebo Crossing Academy**

**To:** Head of School, Nebo Crossing Academy  
**Subject:** Affordable Christian education + affordable character ed platform = perfect match

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

I noticed Nebo Crossing emphasizes affordability and small class 
sizes. As a mission-driven school, you probably can't justify 
$12,000/year for Character Strong.

Good news: You don't have to.

EchoDeed costs $7,500/year and delivers:

✅ Automated character education compliance (90% paperwork reduction)
✅ Parent engagement system (real-time "your teen did something kind" 
   notifications)
✅ Teacher appreciation platform (daily student gratitude messages)
✅ Anonymous student posting (safe environment = your mission)

Your mission is to provide a "safe, Christ-centered environment 
where students inspired to lead." EchoDeed documents that mission 
in action.

Early adopter pricing: $6,000 for first 10 schools - lock in this rate forever (increases to $7,500 after)

#### **EMAIL 10: Veritas Christian Academy**

**To:** Head of School, Veritas Christian Academy  
**Subject:** Classical education + virtue tracking = automated Aristotle

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

Veritas' classical Christian model prepares students for "God's 
Kingdom Purposes." Part of classical education is virtue development 
- and EchoDeed automates the documentation.

Think of it as automated Aristotle:

• Students practice the virtues you teach (kindness, service, 
  gratitude, inclusion)
• EchoDeed timestamps + categorizes each act
• Compliance reports show virtue development over time

When accreditation asks "How are you teaching character?" you'll 
have evidence of PRACTICE (not just curriculum).

Plus:

✅ Anonymous posting teaches humility (virtue without public credit)
✅ Parent notifications strengthen family partnership
✅ Teacher appreciation supports faculty retention

Cost: $7,500/year (less than your curriculum budget, impacts every 
student)

Can I show you the virtue tracking dashboard in 5 minutes?

Best,
Tavores Vanhook

Hi [Head of School Name],

Quick question: How many hours did your team spend last month

EchoDeed reduces that to 2 hours through automated documentation:

#### **EMAIL 19: Heathwood Hall Episcopal School** ⭐⭐⭐

**To:** Head of School, Heathwood Hall Episcopal School  
**Subject:** Episcopal values + anonymous kindness = theology in action

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

Heathwood Hall's mission to "model God's love and grace with 
commitment to the unique worth and beauty of all human beings" 
stopped me in my tracks.

Most character education platforms contradict this mission - public 
recognition boards create social hierarchies where popular students 
get celebrated and quiet students feel invisible.

I built EchoDeed to operationalize Episcopal theology:

ANONYMITY = DIGNITY
• No names, no photos, no popularity contests
• Every student's kindness has equal visibility
• Worth is inherent, not earned through performance

GRACE = UNCONDITIONAL BELONGING
• All students welcomed to participate
• No social pressure to perform for likes
• Community celebrates collective goodness (not individual stars)

HUMILITY = CHARACTER WITHOUT CREDIT
• Students practice virtue without public recognition
• Mirrors Matthew 6:1-4 (don't practice righteousness to be seen)

Your "Mindful in the Hall" program teaches self-awareness. 
EchoDeed gives students a safe space to practice it anonymously.

Plus:

✅ 903 students × real-time parent notifications = family engagement
✅ 14 SCISA Teachers of the Year × daily student appreciation = 
   retention support
✅ Service learning programs × auto-documentation = 90% less 
   paperwork

Cost: $7,500/year ($8.30 per student for 903 students)

I wrote a white paper specifically for Episcopal schools titled 
"Episcopal Values + Anonymous Kindness: A Natural Fit." Want me to 
send it along with a demo link?

#### **EMAIL 20: Christ Church Episcopal School (Greenville)**

**To:** Head of School, Christ Church Episcopal School  
**Subject:** 1,227 students × family engagement = attendance game-changer

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

Christ Church's mission includes "health and wellness, balance, and 
serving the community" - plus teachers who "build community with 
families."

What if you could build that family community 1,227 times per day?

Here's how EchoDeed works:

Student shares kindness → Parent gets notification: "Your teen just 
shared kindness at Christ Church today" → Parent logs in to see what 
they did → Positive dinner conversation about school

This transforms parent-school relationships:

❌ Before: "Please sign this discipline form"
✅ After: "Your teen helped someone today - tell me about it"

When parents hear POSITIVE news from school, attendance improves. 
Family engagement strengthens. Your Episcopal mission of community 
becomes tangible.

Plus:

✅ 90% compliance paperwork reduction (auto-documentation)
✅ Teacher appreciation built in (retention support)
✅ Anonymous posting honors every student's dignity equally

Cost: $7,500/year (less than your annual wellness budget)

Can I show you the parent notification flow in 5 minutes?

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

Faith Christian's commitment to a "loving, relational learning 
environment" is exactly why I built EchoDeed.

Most edtech is transactional (complete this lesson, earn this 
badge). EchoDeed is relational:

Students → Thank teachers who inspired their kindness (relationship)
Parents → Get notified when teen shares kindness (relationship)
Community → Sees collective goodness in anonymous feed 
(relationship)

This strengthens the three relationships that matter most:
1. Student-Teacher (appreciation messages)
2. Student-Parent (positive notifications)
3. Student-Community (belonging through participation)

Plus: Automated compliance documentation (90% paperwork reduction) 
so you spend less time on paperwork, more time on relationships.

Cost: $7,500/year

Can I show you the relational features in a 5-minute demo?

Oconee Christian's "unwavering commitment to Christian character 
development woven seamlessly into strong academic curriculum" is 
inspiring.

Question: When accreditation asks "Can you prove character 
development is happening?" what do you show them?

EchoDeed gives you the proof:

• 500+ timestamped acts of kindness per semester
• Breakdown by character value (service, inclusion, gratitude)
• Real student quotes showing Biblical worldview in action
• Trends over time (character growth = measurable)

Plus: Parents get notified, teachers get appreciated, compliance

Spartanburg Christian's motto "Educating, Equipping, Exhibiting" is

Christian character?

EchoDeed documents the exhibiting:

Students share acts of kindness → System captures evidence → 
Compliance reports show character in action (not just lessons

Hi [Head of School Name],

Dominion Ridge's focus on "competence, confidence, and BELONGING" 
caught my attention - especially BELONGING.

Most schools talk about belonging. You put it in your mission 
statement.

EchoDeed operationalizes it:

ANONYMOUS POSTING = BELONGING WITHOUT PERFORMANCE
• Every student's kindness has equal visibility
• Quiet students feel as valued as outgoing students
• No popularity contests, no social hierarchy

SPECIAL NEEDS INCLUSION = ALREADY YOUR STRENGTH
• EchoDeed's simple interface works for all ability levels
• Participation, not perfection
• Every contribution celebrated equally

SERVICE LEARNING = ALREADY YOUR CURRICULUM
• Preschool through disaster relief trips
• EchoDeed documents service automatically
• Compliance reports ready for accreditation

Plus:

✅ Parents get "your teen shared kindness" notifications (family 
   engagement)
✅ Teachers receive daily appreciation (retention support)
✅ Classical education + automated virtue tracking = Aristotle meets 
   edtech

Cost: $7,500/year

Hi [Head of School Name],

I saw Virginia Academy's 60,000 sq ft expansion in 2024 - that's 
serious growth investment.

As you scale, here's what gets harder:
• Maintaining personalized student attention
• Keeping families engaged as enrollment grows
• Documenting compliance across more students
• Retaining teachers in competitive DC suburbs

EchoDeed scales WITH you:

✅ Anonymous posting maintains belonging even at larger size (every 
   student visible equally)
✅ Parent notifications = 1,000 families engaged daily (not just 
   100 at PTO)
✅ Auto-compliance = same 2 hours/month whether you have 300 or 800 
   students
✅ Teacher appreciation = retention tool as you compete with Fairfax 
   County salaries

Your "servant leadership" program teaches students to serve. 
EchoDeed documents it automatically.

Cost: $7,500/year (one-time, scales with growth)

What's new: States now require you to DOCUMENT it.

EchoDeed makes documentation automatic:

✅ Students practice virtues → System timestamps + categorizes
✅ Compliance reports → One-click export (90% time savings)
✅ Evidence for accreditation → 500+ real examples, not just 
   curriculum

Plus: Your commitment to "physical wellness and character 
development through athletic activities" gets documented alongside 
academic kindness.

Cost: $7,500/year

Can I show you the compliance dashboard in 5 minutes?

#### **EMAIL 33: Ivy League Christian Academy (Virginia Beach)**

**To:** Head of School, Ivy League Christian Academy  
**Subject:** 6-dimension student development = comprehensive data needed

**Email:**

```
Hi [Head of School Name],

Ivy League Christian's 6-dimension development (spiritual, 
intellectual, moral, physical, emotional, social) is impressive.

Question: When parents ask "How is my student developing morally 
and socially?" what do you show them?

EchoDeed provides the proof:

MORAL DIMENSION: 50+ acts of kindness documented per student/year
SOCIAL DIMENSION: Participation rates, community engagement metrics
EMOTIONAL DIMENSION: Safe anonymous sharing (no social pressure)

Plus: Dual accreditation (ICAA + Cognia) = compliance matters. 
EchoDeed auto-generates reports for both.

Cost: $7,500/year

5-minute demo available.

Cornerstone's 30+ year mission to empower students to "reflect

action → Compliance reports show Biblical worldview practiced (not 
just taught)

Plus:

✅ Parent notifications (family discipleship)
✅ Teacher appreciation (retention support)
✅ 90% paperwork reduction

Cost: $7,500/year
