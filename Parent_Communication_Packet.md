## 🤔 **What Is EchoDeed™?**

### **In Simple Terms**
EchoDeed™ is a safe, private platform where students can anonymously share acts of kindness they've witnessed or performed. Think of it as a positive social media feed focused entirely on good deeds and community building.

### **How It Works**
1. **Students observe or perform acts of kindness** (helping a classmate, being inclusive, volunteering, etc.)
2. **They share these stories anonymously** on the school's private EchoDeed™ platform
3. **Other students read and are inspired** by these positive stories
4. **The cycle continues**, creating a culture of kindness throughout the school

### **What Makes It Special**
✅ **Completely Anonymous** - No names, photos, or personal information  
✅ **School-Only Platform** - Only your school's students can participate  
✅ **Positive Content Only** - AI filters ensure only uplifting posts are shared  
✅ **Educational Focus** - Supports Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) requirements
