# EchoDeed™ Revised Go-To-Market Strategy
## School-First Expansion with Strategic Sponsor Support

**Core Principle:** Schools are your primary customer ($6-10K/year each). Local sponsors are supplemental revenue and community validation, not the core business model.

---

## 🎯 **PHASE 1: Local Market Domination (Months 0-6)**
**Goal:** Become the default character education platform for Guilford County high schools

### **Primary Focus: School Expansion (80% of effort)**

3. **Page High School** (1,400 students, Greensboro)
4. **Grimsley High School** (1,600 students, Greensboro)
5. **Southeast Guilford High School** (1,300 students, Greensboro)

## 💰 **REVENUE PROJECTION SUMMARY**

| Phase | Timeline | School ARR | Sponsor ARR | Total ARR | Students |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | Months 0-6 | $38,000 | $3,750* | $38,000 | 7,800 |

| **Phase 3** | Months 18-36 | $460,000 | $70,000** | $530,000 | 50,000+ |

*Phase 1 sponsor revenue is one-time pilot fees, not recurring  
**Phase 2-3 sponsor revenue includes regional + national contracts

---

## 🎯 **KEY STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES**

### **1. Schools Pay the Bills, Sponsors Add Credibility**
- Schools: 85-90% of revenue (predictable, recurring)
- Sponsors: 10-15% of revenue (supplemental, validates community investment)

### **2. Scale Before Selling to National Brands**
- Don't waste time pitching Target until you have 30,000+ students
- National brands need proof of scale + ROI data
- Focus on school expansion first, national sponsors later

### **3. Use A&T Research Strategically**
- Phase 1-2: "Research in progress with A&T State University"
- Phase 3: "Published findings show X% attendance improvement, Y% behavioral reduction"
- Don't promise research results you don't have yet

### **4. Pricing Philosophy**
- Schools: $6,000-8,000/year (high-margin, core business)
- Local sponsors: $750-1,500 pilots → $1,500-3,000/year ongoing
- Regional sponsors: $1,500-5,000/year (CSR budgets)
- National sponsors: $10,000 pilots → $50,000-100,000/year (enterprise)

### **5. Conservative Projections, Aggressive Execution**
- This plan assumes 50% success rates (conservative)
- If you hit 75% success rates, revenue could be 1.5x higher
- Focus on execution quality over quantity

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

**What will make this strategy work:**
1. ✅ **Eastern Guilford reaches 80% adoption** (proves replicability)
2. ✅ **A&T delivers preliminary research data** (validates impact claims)
3. ✅ **Local sponsor pilots show 60%+ redemption** (proves business ROI)
4. ✅ **You stay focused on schools first** (core revenue driver)

**What will derail this strategy:**
1. ❌ Chasing national sponsors too early (waste of time)
2. ❌ Over-promising research results you don't have yet (credibility damage)
3. ❌ Spreading too thin across multiple markets (diluted execution)
4. ❌ Neglecting customer success at existing schools (churn kills growth)

## 📞 **RESOURCE ALLOCATION**

**Your Time Distribution:**

**Phase 1 (Months 0-6):**
- 50% = Eastern Guilford adoption + support
- 30% = New school sales (Guilford County)
- 15% = Local sponsor pilots
- 5% = A&T research coordination

**Phase 2 (Months 6-18):**
- 40% = District contract negotiation

---

## 🎓 **FINAL THOUGHT: THE ENDOWMENT STRATEGY**

**Save the endowment conversation for Year 3+**

Once you have:
- 100+ schools
- $1M+ ARR
- 5 years of A&T longitudinal research data
- Proven 10-20% attendance improvement correlation

**THEN you can approach Chancellor Martin about:**
- Creating an academic research endowment
- Positioning EchoDeed as a social innovation lab
- Securing foundation grants (Gates, Carnegie, Walton Family Foundation)
- Building a nonprofit research arm alongside the for-profit SaaS business

**But not before.** You need product-market fit and revenue traction first.

---

**This is your roadmap. Execute Phase 1 ruthlessly. The rest will follow.**
