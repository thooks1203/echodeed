## ❓ **SLIDE 9: Q&A - Anticipated Questions**

### **"How much time will this take from teachers?"**
> "Minimal. Platform integrates with existing curriculum. Teachers spend 15 minutes per week reviewing wellness dashboards. We provide pre-built lesson plans that fulfill SEL requirements."

### **"What if parents object to the technology?"**
> "Parents have complete opt-out control. We provide transparent communication about all features. 90% of parents appreciate the wellness insights and engagement opportunities."

### **"How do we measure success?"**
> "Built-in analytics track everything: student wellness trends, participation rates, crisis prevention, SEL compliance. You'll have concrete data showing program impact within 30 days."

### **"What about student privacy concerns?"**
> "Complete anonymity is core to our platform. Students feel safer sharing authentically. All data is aggregated and anonymized. FERPA compliance is built-in, not added on."

### **"How is this different from other SEL programs?"**
> "Traditional programs are curriculum-based. We're behavior-based. Students actually DO kindness rather than just learn about it. Real-time data vs annual surveys. Crisis prevention vs crisis response."

### **"What if we decide not to continue after the pilot?"**
> "No obligation whatsoever. You keep all the data and insights from the pilot. We'll even help you transition to other solutions if needed. Zero pressure, zero penalties."
