## Phase 1: Problem Validation (Days 1-10)

### K-8 School Interviews (15 minimum)

**Target Interviewees:**
- 5 Private School Administrators (primary decision makers)
- 3 Public School Principals (budget influence)
- 4 District Technology Directors (procurement process)
- 3 School Counselors/SEL Coordinators (end-user needs)

**Interview Script - Problem Discovery:**

1. "What's your biggest challenge with student wellness and SEL tracking?"
2. "How much time does your staff spend on wellness documentation weekly?"
3. "What tools do you currently use for SEL compliance reporting?"
4. "What would it mean for your school if you could predict student wellness issues 2-4 weeks early?"
5. "What happens when students don't engage with your current SEL programs?"

**Budget Reality Check Questions:**

6. "What do you currently spend annually on SEL/wellness programs?"
7. "Who makes final decisions about spending $5K+ on educational technology?"
8. "What's your typical procurement timeline for new platforms?"
9. "What would need to be true for you to allocate $5K annually to a wellness platform?"

### Corporate HR Discovery Calls (10 minimum)

**Target Interviewees:**
- 4 Chief HR Officers (Fortune 500)
- 3 VP People Operations (Mid-market)
- 3 Employee Experience Directors (Startups)

**Interview Script:**

1. "How do you currently measure employee wellness and engagement?"
2. "What's your biggest frustration with existing wellness platforms?"
3. "How do employees respond to anonymous vs identified feedback tools?"
4. "What would early warning indicators for burnout be worth to your organization?"
5. "What's your current wellness platform budget per employee?"

---

## Phase 2: Solution Validation (Days 11-20)

### Live Platform Demonstrations

**Demo Protocol:**
1. **Show anonymous posting** - Watch administrator reactions to privacy approach
2. **Display real-time analytics** - Gauge interest in dashboard features
3. **Explain IPARD integration** - Test curriculum alignment appeal
4. **Present token economy** - Assess engagement mechanism understanding

**Demo Feedback Questions:**
- "Which features would you actually use?"
- "What's missing that would make this essential?"
- "How does this compare to your current tools?"
- "Would you recommend this to colleague administrators?"

### Van Westendorp Pricing Analysis

**Four-Question Framework:**

1. "At what price would this platform be **too expensive** to consider?"
2. "At what price would you **question the quality**?"
3. "At what price would this be a **bargain**?"
4. "At what price would it be **too expensive but still worth it**?"

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Optimal Price Point (OPP): Where "too cheap" and "too expensive" intersect
- Range of Acceptable Prices (RAP): Floor to ceiling pricing band
- Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC): Lower bound of acceptable pricing
- Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME): Upper bound of acceptable pricing

## Phase 3: Pilot Program Validation (Days 21-30)

### 30-Day School Pilot Structure

**Partner Schools (2-3 target):**
- Eastern Guilford High School (confirmed interest)
- 1-2 additional schools from interview pipeline

**Pilot Metrics to Track:**

| Metric | Target | Warning Signal |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Student signup rate | >60% | <40% |
| Daily active users | >25% | <15% |
| Posts per student/week | >2 | <0.5 |
| Admin dashboard logins | Daily | <3x/week |
| Teacher engagement | >80% | <50% |

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Strong Signal:** 2+ schools willing to pay $3K+/year post-pilot
- ⚠️ **Weak Signal:** Schools interested but only at <$2K/year pricing
- ❌ **Kill Signal:** No schools willing to pay any amount

- Clear differentiation from competitors validated by customers

**YELLOW LIGHT (Pivot required):**
- 5-10 administrators interested but pricing concerns
- Pilot engagement between 30-50%
- Corporate pricing feedback suggests <$10/employee/month
- Competitive positioning needs refinement

**RED LIGHT (Significant pivot or pause):**
- <5 administrators express meaningful interest
- Pilot engagement <30%
- No corporate interest at viable pricing
- Existing solutions perceived as "good enough"

## Pivot Options if Validation Fails

### Pivot A: Freemium Model
**Trigger:** Pricing too high for initial adoption
**Action:** Free tier with limited analytics, premium tier for advanced features
**New Pricing:** Free for basic, $1,500-2,500/year for premium

### Pivot B: District-Only Focus
**Trigger:** Individual school budgets too small
**Action:** Pivot to district-level sales only
**New Pricing:** $25-50K/district/year with volume economics

### Pivot C: Corporate-First Approach
**Trigger:** Education market slower than expected
**Action:** Accelerate corporate wellness development
**Timeline:** 6-month pivot to corporate focus

### Pivot D: Platform Partnership
**Trigger:** Standalone platform adoption too slow
**Action:** Partner with existing EdTech (ClassDojo, Nearpod) as add-on feature
**Revenue Model:** Licensing or revenue share
