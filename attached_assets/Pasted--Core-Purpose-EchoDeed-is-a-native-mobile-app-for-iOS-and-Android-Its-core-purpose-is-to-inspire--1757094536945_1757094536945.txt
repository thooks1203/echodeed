. Core Purpose
EchoDeed™ is a native mobile app for iOS and Android. Its core purpose is to inspire and track anonymous acts of kindness in a community-driven feed. The app's design is based on the philosophy of "Less Ego. More Echo." — prioritizing the collective impact of good deeds over individual recognition.

2. Key User Flow
The app's user experience is designed to be simple and frictionless.

A user opens the app and immediately sees a live, public feed of kindness posts and a global Kindness Counter.

To post, a user taps a prominent "Post a Deed" button.

They write a short, text-only description of their kind act.

Upon submitting, their post appears on the feed, and the global Kindness Counter increases by one.

Users can easily browse the feed, but cannot interact with posts via likes, comments, or messages.

3. Core Features

Anonymous Posting: All posts are completely anonymous. There are no user profiles, no names, no followers, and no personal information of any kind attached to a post.

The Kindness Feed: The central hub of the app is a simple, single, scrollable feed. It is text-only to maintain simplicity and focus.

Kindness Counter: A highly visible, real-time counter on the home screen that displays the total number of EchoDeeds™ performed globally since the app's launch. This is the app's primary form of "social proof" and reinforcement.

No Social Interaction: To maintain a positive-only environment, the app strictly prohibits all forms of social interaction on posts, including comments, likes, hearts, or direct messaging.

Filtering and Search: Users can filter the Kindness Feed by location (e.g., city, state, country) to see local impact. They can also use a few predefined categories to filter posts, such as "Helping Others," "Community Action," or "Spreading Positivity."

Verification System (Simple Version for MVP): To ensure a trust-based community, the app will incorporate a simple system. Posts are automatically flagged if they contain profanity or keywords associated with negativity. This will help maintain the integrity of the feed.

4. App's Tone and Aesthetics

Visuals: The app should have a clean, minimalist design with a positive and uplifting color palette. The focus should be on readability and ease of use.

Messaging: The tone should be encouraging, humble, and positive.

Onboarding: The onboarding process should be quick and simple, with a clear statement about the app's purpose and a quick path to viewing and posting kindness.
