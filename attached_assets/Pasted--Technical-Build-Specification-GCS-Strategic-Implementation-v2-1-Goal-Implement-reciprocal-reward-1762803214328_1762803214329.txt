 Technical Build Specification: GCS Strategic Implementation (v2.1)Goal: Implement reciprocal reward features and process-based tracking to align with GCS's IPARD model and Service-Learning Diploma requirements, making EchoDeed the superior platform for student engagement.1. Feature Implementation: Reciprocal Incentives for Process (The "Give")The GCS handbook confirms that students must complete five components: Investigation, Preparation & Planning, Action, Reflection, and Demonstration (IPARD)1. We will reward the often-ignored, high-effort steps (I, P, R, D).Module: $ECHO$ Token System & Service Hour FlowIDSpecificationGCS Alignment / RationaleB-5.1Investigate/Prepare Token Award: Award 25 Bonus Tokens upon a student's initial digital submission of the Service-Learning Approval Form 2 via EchoDeed.Rewards I & P: Incentivizes the student for starting the required planning process before the service begins3.B-5.2Reflection Token Award: Award 50 Bonus Tokens upon teacher approval of a High-Quality Reflection submitted via the Reflection Log module4.Rewards R: Directly rewards depth and critical thinking, which the handbook heavily emphasizes5.B-5.3Demonstration Token Award: Award 75 Bonus Tokens upon verification that the student has used the Demonstration tool (e.g., uploading a photo/link of them sharing their experience)6.Rewards D: Incentivizes the final, mandatory sharing component7.2. Feature Implementation: Administrative "Give-Back" SystemThis feature creates the tangible, reciprocal "give" from school leadership, shifting the administrative mindset.Module: Admin & Teacher Dashboards / Rewards PortalIDSpecificationRationaleB-6.1School Rewards Portal (Admin View): Create a dedicated Admin Portal for Principals/APs to easily allocate and manage a limited number of high-value, non-token rewards (e.g., VIP Parking Spots, Homework Passes).Facilitates visible leadership reciprocation without manual tracking.B-6.2"Character Excellence" Token Award: Implement a manual override function allowing teachers to award "Character Excellence Tokens" (500+ tokens) for acts of integrity or exceptional character observed in the classroom.Empowers teachers to reward intrinsic character traits and leadership8.B-6.3Monthly Recognition List: Admin dashboard generates a clear list of the Top 5 Token Earners per grade, facilitating easy public recognition by the principal (e.g., announcement/social media).Creates positive school-wide visibility and promotes the program internally.3. Academic & Compliance Alignment RefinementsThese ensure EchoDeed's data matches GCS's specific documentation needs, making it easier to replace x2VOL's function.Module: Reflection Form & Admin ReportsIDSpecificationHandbook AlignmentB-7.1Reflection Tagging Feature: Update the Reflection Form 9to allow students to tag which 21st Century Learning Skills (e.g., Accountability, Critical Thinking) and Character Traits (e.g., Kindness, Integrity) they developed, based on the options listed in the Teacher Documentation Form10.Aligns the student's reflection output with the data points required by GCS staff11.B-7.2IPARD Tracking Status: Display the status of each Service-Learning experience (e.g., Phase: Investigation Complete, Reflection Pending) on the Student Log 1212 and Teacher/Admin Dashboard.Provides real-time visibility into the entire mandatory process, not just the hours13.B-7.3Service Provider Verification Process: Enhance the photo verification module to ensure the student uploads a document clearly showing the Service-Learning Provider's signature and contact information 141414 before the teacher's one-click approval.Reinforces the parental/provider verification expectations outlined in the handbook15.
