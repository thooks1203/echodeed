Current Issue
Browser error:
index-clean-FINAL.js:1 Failed to load module script... MIME type text/html

This means the request to /assets/index-clean-FINAL.js is returning HTML (a fallback page) instead of JavaScript. That happens when the server can’t find the JS file and serves index.html instead.

Confirmed Findings
www.echodeed.com returns HTML for the JS file:
GET /assets/index-clean-FINAL.js → 200 text/html
So the server fallback route is being hit, not a real JS file.
Root Cause (most likely)
The static assets being served at runtime are missing or served from the wrong directory.
Your backend serves static files from dist/public (Express production mode).
If the file is missing there, it returns index.html for every path → MIME error.

What We Already Tried
✅ Fixing cache loop
Service worker v5.0.0: never cache JS/CSS
Renamed bundle to index-clean-FINAL.js
Hard refresh / clear storage / SW unregister
✅ Fixing build/import errors
Removed bad import from main.jsx
Simplified Dashboard with hardcoded cards
Vite build succeeds on Railway (Node 20.20.0)
✅ Ensuring bundle filename matches
vite.config.ts outputs assets/index-clean-FINAL.js
index.html updated to reference index-clean-FINAL.js
✅ Verified runtime server config
Production server serves static from dist/public
If public missing, it would crash, but it starts fine
✅ New Actions Added
Sync script to copy build output into server/public:

Added sync-public.mjs
Build script now: vite build && node scripts/sync-public.mjs
Updated index.html to reference index-clean-FINAL.js
Server fallback updated (in bundled server):

If dist/public missing, fallback to server/public
Logs which static path is used
Why It Still Fails
The new fixes just shipped, and the DNS/hosting for www.echodeed.com might still be serving:

Old build output
A different container instance
Or a static folder that doesn’t include index-clean-FINAL.js
What to Look For in Logs
After the latest deploy, Railway should log:


Static assets path: /app/dist/public
or


Static assets path: /app/server/public
If you don’t see that line, the new server bundle isn’t what’s running yet.

Commands / Checks We Ran
GET https://www.echodeed.com → HTML references index-clean-FINAL.js
GET https://www.echodeed.com/assets/index-clean-FINAL.js → 200 text/html (wrong)
Summary in One Line
The server is returning HTML for the JS bundle because the static assets aren’t being found in the directory it’s actually serving. We added build-time syncing + runtime fallback to fix that, and the new deploy needs to be confirmed via log
