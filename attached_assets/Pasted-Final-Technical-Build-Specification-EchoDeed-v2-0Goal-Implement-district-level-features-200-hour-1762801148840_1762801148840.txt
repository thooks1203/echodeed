Final Technical Build Specification: EchoDeed™ v2.0Goal: Implement district-level features (200-hour tracking, Academic/Inclusion data) and streamline the UI to eliminate complexity and legal liability.1. Implementations (Features to ADD)These additions directly address district feedback on academic rigor, intrinsic motivation, and systemic data.1.1. Academic & Graduation Alignment (200-Hour Goal)IDSpecificationModuleB-1.1Update Default Service Hour Goal to "200 Hours."Service Hour TrackingB-1.2Update Goal Language to reference "Service Learning Diploma Goal (4-Year Requirement)."Service Hour Tracking1.2. Intrinsic Motivation & Character (Legacy Impact)IDSpecificationModuleB-2.1New Section: "My Legacy Impact" on Student Dashboard for intrinsic impact metrics.Student ProfileB-2.2Feature: Kindness Footprint - Implement a Visual Chart displaying the student's breakdown of posts by category (e.g., Peer Support, Community Service).Student DashboardB-2.3Feature: Character Strengths Meter - Algorithm analyzes the student's 5 most frequently used post categories/tags over 90 days to label their "Top 3 Emerging Virtues." (Visible to student/parent only.)Student Dashboard1.3. Proactive Behavioral Mitigation (Inclusion Score)IDSpecificationModuleB-3.1New Metric: Inclusion Score - System-wide metric visible on the Admin/Teacher Dashboard Reports.AI Pattern AnalyzerB-3.2Inclusion Score Algorithm - Program AI to track frequency of positive acts containing inclusion-related keywords: "new student," "sitting alone," "invited to join," etc.AI Pattern Analyzer1.4. Academic Data Correlation (Research Readiness)IDSpecificationModuleB-4.2Visual: Engagement vs. Attendance - Implement a placeholder Scatter Plot/Line Graph showing a correlation between Active EchoDeed User Rate and Aggregate Student Attendance Rate (for demo only).Admin Dashboard ReportsB-4.3Visual: Engagement vs. Grades - Implement a placeholder Bar Graph showing a correlation between High EchoDeed User Group and Average GPA/Pass Rate (for demo only).Admin Dashboard Reports2. Eliminations & Consolidations (Features to REMOVE or Streamline)These removals simplify the UI, reduce administrative overhead, and mitigate legal/moderation liability.IDSpecificationRationaleE-1Eliminate Specific Kindness Reactions (e.g., "Love it!" or "I'll do this too!").Reduces UI clutter, complexity, and prevents the perception of "likes/social comparison."E-2Eliminate Parent Community Discussion Board.Mitigates severe legal/moderation liability; not a core value driver.E-3Consolidate Teacher Rewards Tab.Remove the separate primary tab. If rewards exist for staff, display as a simple balance on the Teacher Dashboard Overview.
