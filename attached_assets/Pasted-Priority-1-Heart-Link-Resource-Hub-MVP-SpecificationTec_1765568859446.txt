Specific EGHS Counselor Contact Info (Name, Email, Office Phone).BrandingMust include a dedicated space for the Founding Wellness Partner logo/text (e.g., <div id="wellness_sponsor"></div>).Priority 2: Anonymous Pulse Check (The Data Revolution)SpecificationTechnical RequirementTrigger & FrequencyA modal pop-up appears on the user's first login/session of the day (once per 24 hours).Input/Data CollectionSimple 5-point scale (e.g., 5 emojis). The input must be logged to a non-user-facing database table, recording: timestamp, school_ID, grade_level, unique_user_ID, and rating_value (1-5).Anonymity Protocol (CRITICAL)The unique_user_ID MUST NOT be readable by anyone outside of your internal developer system. The Admin dashboard should never display a name or email connected to a rating.Admin Notification LogicThe system must run a daily cron job checking two conditions: Condition A (Aggregate Drop): If the school's average score drops below 2.5. Condition B (Individual Trigger): If a single unique_user_ID has recorded a rating of 1 (lowest score) three times in the last 7 days.Notification ActionIf Condition A or B is met, an automated email is sent to a pre-defined school contact list (egms_counselors@school.edu). The email should state the condition met (Aggregate/Individual) but only include the student's internal, non-identifying user ID for the individual trigger.Admin View (MVP)A new simple chart/graph showing the average Pulse Check score over the last 7 days for the school/grade level.
