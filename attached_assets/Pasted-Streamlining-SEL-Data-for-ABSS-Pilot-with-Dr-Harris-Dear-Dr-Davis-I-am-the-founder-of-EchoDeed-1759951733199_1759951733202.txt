Streamlining SEL Data for ABSS: Pilot with Dr. Harris

Dear Dr. Davis,

I am the founder of EchoDeed™, and I'm reaching out because we've built a platform that addresses a challenge widely documented in districts implementing SEL and character education programs: the administrative burden falls heavily on already-overworked teachers.

I have a deep personal investment in the success of ABSS: I am a product of the public school system, and I live just two miles from Broadview Middle and Cummings High.

What EchoDeed Does:

My platform, EchoDeed™, is mostly student-led, which is key to its efficiency. It's a secure tool designed using established SEL research (principles championed by organizations like CASEL) that links student belonging to positive attendance.

Automates service hour verification – Designed to reduce teacher verification time from 15 minutes to 30 seconds per student through photo-based verification and one-click approval

Tracks real-time SEL engagement data – Anonymous kindness posts, student participation rates, and character development metrics

Provides exportable analytics – School-wide climate metrics, behavioral trends, and student engagement data in CSV format for your reporting needs

We're preparing to launch a pilot at Eastern Guilford High School with Principal Dr. Darrell Harris (Guilford County Principal of the Year), who has agreed to demo the platform for his school's character education initiative.

Why I'm Reaching Out:

Our platform collects the type of data districts need to demonstrate SEL program effectiveness for Title IV and ESSA funding. While we don't currently auto-generate federal reports, we're exploring how to better align our data exports with the specific compliance requirements districts like yours face.

We are currently working to partner with the NC A&T State University College of Education to address this challenge:

The Goal: Upon securing this partnership, we aim for A&T researchers to apply their academic expertise to scientifically validate and prove that this initiative significantly moves the needle on student grades, attendance, and a strong sense of belonging.

I'd value 15 minutes of your time to:

Show you how the platform is designed to reduce teacher administrative burden

Learn what data formats would be most useful for your federal reporting process

Explore whether a partnership makes sense for Alamance-Burlington Schools

Would you be available for a brief call next week?

Sincerely,

Tavores Vanhook
