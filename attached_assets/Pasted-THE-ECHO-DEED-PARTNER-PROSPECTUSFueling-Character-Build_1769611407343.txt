It should feel like a "deal," not a flyer.The Sticker Mock-up: If you can, show them a picture on your phone of what the "Community Partner" decal will look like on a glass door.The "Category" Pressure: Mention casually, "I'm heading over to [Competitor] next, but I wanted to stop here first because I know you guys are really involved with the schools." (The Scarcity Principle in action!)
