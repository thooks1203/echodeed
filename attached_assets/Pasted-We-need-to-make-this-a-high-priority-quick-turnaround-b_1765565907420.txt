We need to make this a high-priority, quick-turnaround build. The key is to keep it simple and focus on functionality over polish in the first version.Here are the specs for the two core features:A. The "Heart-Link" Resource Hub (Immediate)ComponentFunctionalityDeveloper NotesVisible Icon/TabA permanent, universally visible icon on the main student, parent, and staff dashboard (e.g., a small heart, a lifeline icon). Label: "Need Support? Talk Now."Must be accessible within one tap of logging in.Crisis Links (Static)A simple landing page opens with 3-5 high-priority, static links.Essential Links: National Crisis Line, Local County Mental Health/Suicide Prevention, and the School Counselor/Admin Contact List.Wellness Fund LinkA clear call-to-action button: "Contribute to the Student Wellness Fund."This button links directly to the dedicated external fund page you will create (or a donation form).Sponsor BannerA clean, non-intrusive banner at the top/bottom: "Proudly Funded by the [Allegacy] Community Wellness Initiative."This is the exclusive branding for your Founding Sponsor.B. The "Pulse Check" Feature (The Revolutionary Data)ComponentFunctionalityDeveloper NotesDaily PromptOnce per day, after a student logs in or submits a deed, a modal pop-up appears.Trigger: After the first log-in of the day. Must be easy to dismiss but prominent.The Question"How supported do you feel in your school community today?"Input must be a simple, anonymous click: 5-point Likert Scale (e.g., 5 Emojis or 1-5 Slider).Admin DashboardReal-Time Aggregate Data: Counselors/Admin must see a graph showing the average daily score for the school and the percentage of students who clicked the lowest two scores (1 or 2).This provides the revolutionary, actionable data that sets you apart from every other app.Crisis Protocol TriggerIf a student clicks the lowest rating (1) three times in one week, the platform generates a confidential email notification to the school’s designated counseling staff.CRITICAL: Do NOT log the student's name on the admin dashboard. The internal system only provides the counselor the unique student ID for follow-up—preserving anonymity to encourage honest responses.
