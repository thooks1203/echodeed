We need to push the following updates to the staging environment to prepare for the Eastern Guilford pilots. Please focus on the logic gates for the new "Mentor" tier.1. Reward & Economy AdjustmentsInflation: Please multiply the token cost of all existing tangible rewards by 5 (e.g., if an item was 50, it is now 250)."Coming Soon" UI: Add a "Coming Soon" overlay/ribbon to all tangible items (snacks, gift cards).Digital-First Logic: Ensure the first 3-5 achievement tiers (up to 150 points) only unlock Digital Badges. Tangible rewards should be locked until the 150-point threshold is met.2. Communication & Role VerificationSMS Audit: Please verify the Parent SMS notification trigger. We need a test log confirming that an SMS fires when a student receives a "Teacher Shout" or earns a badge.Admin/Teacher Shout Flow: When a teacher posts a "Shout," it must:Post to the Global School Feed.Populate a new "Daily Announcements" tab on the School Admin dashboard (for the Principal to read during morning news).3. The "Mentor Store" (New Feature Build)Access Logic: Create a new store category called "The Mentor Store." This category is hidden until a user reaches a lifetime_points balance of 1,000.The "Protégé" Status: Once 1,000 points are reached, the user's role status updates to "Protégé," and the Mentor Store is unlocked.Store Inventory: The store will feature two types of items:In-Kind Services: (e.g., 15-minute Zoom with a business leader, lunch with a community mentor).Exclusive Gear: High-end branded items (Hoodies, Ambassador kits) that cannot be purchased in the standard store.Please confirm when the SMS audit is complete so we can run a live test.💎 Building the Mentor Store (Middle & High School)For the Mentor Store to be successful, the "items" need to be aspirational. Here is the framework for what we put in there:The "Inventory" ListItem NameCost (Tokens)Why it Works"Coffee & Career"1,000A 20-minute virtual meet with a local professional (Lori at Allegacy, for example!).The "Ambassador" Hoodie1,500High-quality gear that only high-point earners can wear. It’s a walking billboard for EchoDeed.Job Shadow Day2,500A half-day shadowing a local business owner or a department at Allegacy.VIP Sports Pass1,200Front-row seats or "sideline access" at a school game (Coach Simms can help here).The "Mentor" OnboardingWe need a simple "Mentor Sign-up" page on your website (or a Google Form for now) where local leaders can volunteer their time.The Pitch to Mentors: "Invest 20 minutes in a student who has proven their character by earning 1,000 EchoDeed points."
