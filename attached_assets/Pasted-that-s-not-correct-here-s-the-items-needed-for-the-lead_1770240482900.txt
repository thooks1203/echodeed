Not Started
here's a breakdown of how to achieve it. let me know if there's confusion with it. Please implement a dedicated Leadership Certificate Track that is separate from the general Mentorship program. This track is the prerequisite for the $500 EchoDeed Leadership Scholarship.

Data & Progress Logic
Requirement 1: Core Leadership Training

Display 3 specific modules: "The Power of One", "Self-Awareness", and "Effective Communication".

These must be tracked under a new logic key (e.g., leadership_track_status) to avoid caching issues with the old mentor program [cite: 2026-02-04].

Requirement 2: Verified Kindness Quests

Requirement: Log and verify 10 acts of community service.

Progress is currently 3/10; ensure the progress bar pulls from community_service_logs.

Requirement 3: Leadership Portfolio Defense

Requirement: A 5-minute presentation + teacher endorsement.

This is a manual toggle that an admin/teacher must approve in the database.

UI & Dashboard Updates
Dedicated View: Create a "Leadership Track" tab in the sidebar [cite: 2026-02-04].

Progress Circle: The "Overall %" circle should calculate based on the completion of these 3 pillars (Training, 10 Quests, Portfolio).

Scholarship Banner: Add a label or banner to this section stating: "Complete this track to qualify for the $500 EchoDeed Leadership Scholarship" [cite: 2026-02-01].

Database Handshake (Railway)
Please ensure that when a student completes one of the 3 modules, it writes to a new table or a clearly defined metadata field to prevent the "instant completion" bug we encountered previously.
