this was a brain dump after tossing & turning last night! i tried to organize it so it makes sense, but i'm open to your suggestions too. also change the tokens that teachers can award from 500-1000 to 50-250. need to figure out Ms McNeil's rewards (ex open gym, etc)

This is a solid plan for the Eastern Guilford pilot! Let me explore the current reward system and create a structured plan:

This is a comprehensive feature set for the Eastern Guilford school pilot. Let me organize this into a clear plan:

Searched for "Where do teachers or coaches award tokens/points to students? Look for token awarding UI, giving points, or shout-out features."
Looking at your codebase, I don't see an existing teacher token awarding system - this appears to be a new feature set for the Eastern Guilford school pilot.

Before I start building, I have a few quick questions:

Where do teachers currently award tokens (50-250)? Is there an existing page/feature I should look at, or is this being built fresh for Eastern Guilford?

There's an existing teacher reward system I should find
uploading it to you now
For Ms. McNeil's school-specific rewards, here are some ideas that work well for middle/high school:

Open Gym (50 tokens)
Lunch with Teacher (75 tokens)
Homework Pass (100 tokens)
Front of Lunch Line (25 tokens)
Choose Your Seat Day (50 tokens)
Music During Work Time (40 tokens)
Extra Credit Assignment (150 tokens)
Should I add these, or do you have a specific list from Ms. McNeil?

Use these suggested rewards for now
I see the Teacher Dashboard is on echodeed.com - that appears to be a separate site. Let me check if this codebase has any EchoDeed-related code:

The Teacher Dashboard you showed is on echodeed.com - that's a separate site from this HeirKeep project. Should I:

You'll open the EchoDeed project separately so I can make changes there
sorry, i was in the wrong app. if you made any changes to heirkeep for echodeed, kill them. so, when i open echodeed, these changes will already be in place?

No worries! I did not make any EchoDeed changes to HeirKeep - I asked you the clarifying question before starting, so nothing needs to be reverted here.

And to clarify: No, the changes won't automatically be in EchoDeed. When you open the EchoDeed project, I'll need to work on it there to make those changes.

The only changes I made to HeirKeep today were:

Fixed athlete vs legacy signup tracking
Updated SMS consent language for Twilio compliance
Both of those are HeirKeep-specific and correct. You're all good!
