**Goal**: High-energy, problem-solution focus for busy Middle School Principals.

---

## 0:00 - 0:45 | THE HOOK & THE PROBLEM
- **Action**: Screen share of the **Kindness Feed** scrolling.
- **Script**: "Hi [Principal Name], I’m Tavores. Middle school is where social-emotional foundations are built, but your staff is likely overwhelmed tracking character ed on spreadsheets. EchoDeed turns that burden into a culture of belonging. It's a mobile-first platform where students anonymously recognize kindness. No drama, no popularity contests—just pure positive reinforcement."

## 0:45 - 2:00 | STUDENT EXPERIENCE (The "How")
- **Action**: Click 'Share Kindness' button.
- **Script**: "Here’s the student view. It’s anonymous by design to remove social fear. A student sees a classmate being helpful, taps 'Share,' selects a category, and done. Our AI filters for safety instantly. Students earn tokens for milestones (25, 75, 150) which they redeem for real rewards from 21 local Greensboro partners like Chick-fil-A and the Science Center. We’ve gamified 'being a good human'."

## 2:00 - 3:15 | ADMIN & TEACHER POWER (The "Data")
- **Action**: Switch to **Admin Dashboard / Inclusion Score**.
- **Script**: "For you, this is a data goldmine. This **Inclusion Score** is a real-time pulse on your school climate. If belonging drops, you see it here first. No more guessing or waiting for end-of-year surveys. Teachers can also award 'Character Excellence' tokens with one click, documenting state-required character ed compliance automatically. You get the data; they get the recognition."

## 3:15 - 4:15 | SAFETY & FULL-SCHOOL ROLLOUT
- **Action**: Show **Eastern Guilford Middle** launch mention in features doc.
- **Script**: "We are COPPA and FERPA strict. No direct messaging, no names on posts. We’re currently rolling out school-wide at Eastern Guilford Middle. They’re using our 'First to 100%' enrollment contest to win an Open Gym period—it’s driving massive engagement because students *want* to be seen for doing the right thing."

## 4:15 - 5:00 | THE CALL TO ACTION
- **Action**: Show your **Contact Info**.
- **Script**: "I want to offer you a 30-day no-cost pilot for one grade level. I’ll provide the parent consent forms, the teacher training, and the local rewards. Let’s build a culture where kindness is the loudest voice in your hallways. Which grade level should we start with? Talk soon!"

## Alternative Demo Platforms for Longer Videos
If Loom's 5-minute limit is a blocker, consider **Tella.tv**.
- **Why**: They offer a generous free tier, better editing, and often allow longer recordings (usually up to 7-10 mins on free) compared to Loom's strict 5-minute cap for free users.
- **Other option**: **ScreenPal** (formerly Screencast-O-Matic) allows 15-minute recordings on their free version.
