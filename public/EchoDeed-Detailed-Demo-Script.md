# EchoDeed™ Detailed Demo Script (Middle School)
**Target Duration**: 7-10 minutes
**Audience**: Middle School Principals & Counselors

---

## 0:00-1:00 | THE VISION & THE "WHY"
- **Visual**: Screen share of the **Kindness Feed** scrolling live.
- **Script**: "Hi, I’m Tavores Vanhook, and I want to show you how we’re transforming school culture by making kindness the loudest voice in the building. Middle school is a critical window for social-emotional growth, yet most schools are still tracking character education manually on spreadsheets. EchoDeed replaces that administrative burden with a mobile-first platform where students anonymously recognize good deeds, building a genuine sense of belonging without the social pressure of traditional social media."

## 1:00-3:00 | THE STUDENT JOURNEY: "SEE IT, SHARE IT"
- **Visual**: Click 'Share Kindness' and walk through the 3 steps.
- **Script**: "Here is the student experience. It’s simple, safe, and anonymous. 
1. **The Post**: A student sees a peer helping someone and taps 'Share.' They select a category—like 'Integrity' or 'Respect'—and write a brief note. Our AI instantly checks for profanity or negative keywords before it hits the feed.
2. **The Workflow**: For middle school, we use a 3-phase model: Explore, Do, and Reflect. We aren't requiring 200 hours like high school; we are building the habit of reflection.
3. **The Reward**: Every post earns tokens. We’ve partnered with 21 local Greensboro businesses—Chick-fil-A, the Science Center, local theaters. When they hit milestones (25, 75, 150 tokens), they get real-world rewards. We aren't just telling them to be kind; we’re celebrating it in a way they actually care about."

## 3:00-5:00 | ADMIN POWER: THE INCLUSION SCORE
- **Visual**: Switch to **Admin Dashboard**.
- **Script**: "This is where we solve your biggest headaches. 
1. **The Inclusion Score**: This is a real-time pulse of your school climate. Most schools wait for end-of-year surveys to see if students feel included. You see it every morning. If the score drops, you can intervene before it becomes a behavioral trend.
2. **Compliance**: Every interaction is logged. When it’s time to report on your character education initiatives, you don't need to gather papers. You just click 'Export.'
3. **Teacher Kudos**: Teachers can award 'Character Excellence' tokens (500-1000) for extraordinary acts. It takes a teacher 30 seconds, but for a 7th grader, that recognition can change their entire trajectory."

## 5:00-6:30 | ADDRESSING YOUR QUESTIONS (FAQ)
- **Script**: "Let’s talk about the questions I know you have:
- **Safety?** We are COPPA and FERPA strict. There is no direct messaging between students. It is a recognition platform, not a social network.
- **Time?** Implementation takes 30 minutes of teacher training. Once it’s launched, it runs itself.
- **Cost?** We are a mission-driven partner. We handle the local business reward integrations so you don't have to.
- **Devices?** It’s a Progressive Web App. If they don't have phones, it works on any library computer or classroom tablet."

## 6:30-8:00 | PROVEN SUCCESS: EASTERN GUILFORD & CONTESTS
- **Visual**: Show the **Rollout Ideas** or **Eastern Guilford** mention.
- **Script**: "We aren't just testing this; it’s working. At Eastern Guilford Middle, they’re rolling this out school-wide. One of our most successful strategies is the 'Enrollment Race'—whichever grade level hits 70% enrollment first wins an 'Open Gym' period. Students start holding each other accountable for being part of the 'Kindness Club.' We provide these rollout templates so your launch is a guaranteed win."

## 8:00-9:00 | THE CALL TO ACTION
- **Visual**: Your **Contact Info** and the **Parent Consent Email** preview.
- **Script**: "I’m offering you a 30-day, no-cost pilot for one grade level. I’ll provide the parent consent emails—which are written to hit home with parents why this matters—I'll handle the rewards, and I’ll train your staff. My goal is to make [School Name] the kindest school in the district. Let’s pick a start date. Which grade level do you think is ready for this?"
