- [ ] Pull up Inclusion Score dashboard

---

## OPENING (2 minutes)

### Hook Question
> "How much time does your staff spend each month documenting character education compliance?"

*Pause for answer*

> "What if I told you there's a way to do that automatically—while actually increasing student belonging and reducing behavioral issues?"

### Introduction
> "EchoDeed is a mobile-first platform designed specifically for middle school students. It lets them anonymously share kind acts they witness or perform, earn rewards for positive behavior, and build a culture of belonging—all while giving you real-time data on your school's behavioral climate."

---

## DEMO SECTION 1: Student Experience (4 minutes)

### Show the Student Dashboard
> "Here's what your students see when they open EchoDeed. It's designed for phones—because that's what kids use."

**Walk through:**
1. **The Kindness Feed**
   > "This is the real-time feed of kindness happening at your school. Students can see their classmates doing good—anonymously. Notice there are no names, so there's no social pressure or fear of judgment."

2. **Sharing a Kind Act**
   > "When a student wants to share, they tap this button. Let me show you..."
   
   *Demo the post flow:*
   > "They select a category—like 'Helped a Classmate' or 'Showed Respect'—write a quick description, and submit. Our AI instantly checks for appropriate content before it goes live."

3. **The Simple Workflow**
   > "For middle school, we use a three-phase approach: Explore, Do, Reflect. It's simple enough for 6th graders but meaningful enough to build character foundations."

4. **Tokens and Rewards**
   > "Students earn tokens for sharing kindness. At 25 tokens, they hit their first milestone. Then 75, 150, and 300. Notice these are much lower than high school—we want younger students to feel successful quickly."

## DEMO SECTION 2: Teacher Features (3 minutes)

### Show Teacher Dashboard
> "Now let me show you what your teachers see."

**Walk through:**
1. **Character Excellence Awards**
   > "Teachers can award tokens to students who show exceptional character. It requires your approval before the student receives it—you stay in control."

2. **Class Kindness Trends**
   > "Teachers can see which kindness categories are trending in their class. This helps them know what's working and where to focus character education."

3. **Moderation Queue**
   > "Any flagged content comes here for human review. Your teachers—or counselors—can quickly approve or remove posts."

---

## DEMO SECTION 3: Administrator Dashboard (4 minutes)

### Show Admin Dashboard
> "This is where the magic happens for administrators."

**Walk through:**
1. **Real-Time Inclusion Score**
   > "This number represents how connected and included your students feel—based on their participation and engagement patterns. You can track this weekly, monthly, or over the school year."

2. **Behavioral Climate Monitor**
   > "Our AI analyzes posting patterns to detect early warning signs. If there's a shift in school climate—like after a major event or during testing season—you'll see it here before it becomes a problem."

3. **Character Education Compliance**
   > "Every kindness post, every teacher recognition, every service activity—it's all documented automatically. No more spreadsheets. No more paper forms. Export to CSV anytime for district reporting."

4. **Badge & Achievement Summary**
   > "See which students are earning badges, who's most active, and how engagement grows over time."

---

## DEMO SECTION 4: Safety & Compliance (2 minutes)

### Address Safety Concerns
> "I know safety is your top priority—especially with middle schoolers. Let me show you what we've built."

**Cover these points:**
- **COPPA Compliance**: "We require enhanced parental consent before any student under 13 can participate."
- **Enhanced Moderation**: "Content filtering is stricter than our high school version. Every post goes through AI review plus human moderation."
- **No Direct Messaging**: "Students can't message each other. This is a recognition platform, not a social network."
- **Anonymous by Design**: "Names aren't attached to posts, so there's no bullying, no popularity contests, no social drama."

---

## DEMO SECTION 5: What Makes Us Different (2 minutes)

### Key Differentiators
> "You might be wondering what makes EchoDeed different from other character education programs."

1. **No Service Hour Pressure**
   > "For middle school, community service is optional and encouraged—not required. We're building foundations, not checking boxes."

2. **Dual Rewards**
   > "Students AND parents earn rewards. When a student redeems tokens, parents get a notification and their own reward. This gets families involved."

3. **Local Business Partnerships**
   > "We've partnered with 21 local Greensboro businesses—Chick-fil-A, the Science Center, local movie theaters. Kids redeem tokens for real rewards they care about."

4. **Real Data, Not Surveys**
   > "Instead of asking students 'Do you feel like you belong?', we measure it through their actual behavior. That's more accurate and less biased."

---

## CLOSING (2 minutes)

### The Ask
> "Here's what I'd like to propose: a 30-day pilot with one grade level or one team. No cost, no commitment. Just let us show you what EchoDeed can do for your school culture."

### Next Steps
> "If you're interested, I can:
> 1. Set up your school account today
> 2. Schedule a 30-minute teacher training
> 3. Provide parent consent forms in English and Spanish
> 4. Check in after two weeks to review your data"

### Final Question
> "What questions do you have? And which grade level would be the best fit for a pilot?"

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "We already have a character education program."
> "That's great—EchoDeed isn't meant to replace it. It's a tool that amplifies what you're already doing and gives you data to prove it's working."

### "Our students don't have phones."
> "We're mobile-first, but EchoDeed works on any device with a browser—computers in the library, tablets in classrooms, even the TV in your lobby can display the kindness feed."

### "How much does it cost?"
> "For the pilot, nothing. After that, we work with your district on pricing based on enrollment. Most schools find the administrative time savings alone justify the investment."

### "What about students who don't participate?"
> "That's actually valuable data too. If certain students aren't engaging, that might indicate they need additional support. The Inclusion Score helps identify those patterns."

### "My teachers don't have time for this."
> "The training is 30 minutes. Day-to-day, teachers only engage when they want to give a Character Excellence Award—which takes about 60 seconds. Everything else runs automatically."
