## 🏆 5 Rollout Contest Ideas to Drive Success

These proven strategies create excitement, healthy competition, and rapid adoption. Customize based on your school culture!

### 1. The Enrollment Race: "First to 100%"
**How it works**: Whichever grade level reaches 70-100% enrollment in EchoDeed first wins a reward.
**Reward idea**: Open Gym period, Extended Lunch, or Dance Party Friday
**Why it works**: Creates peer-to-peer encouragement ("Did you sign up yet?") and visible momentum
**Pro tip**: Announce daily progress during morning announcements

### 2. Kindness Week Challenge
**How it works**: One week where every kindness post earns double tokens. Grade with most posts wins.
**Reward idea**: Pizza party, Ice cream social, or Movie afternoon
**Why it works**: Concentrated burst of activity creates habit formation
**Pro tip**: Launch during a natural transition (after winter break, start of semester)

### 3. Teacher vs. Students Showdown
**How it works**: Can teachers collectively post more Staff-to-Student recognitions than students post kindness acts?
**Reward idea**: If students win = Pajama Day. If teachers win = Students do extra community service project together
**Why it works**: Creates fun rivalry and models adult participation
**Pro tip**: Display live counter in cafeteria or main hallway

### 4. The "First 50" Early Adopter Club
**How it works**: First 50 students to sign up AND make a kindness post get exclusive benefits
**Reward idea**: Special badge in app, VIP lunch table for a week, first access to reward redemptions
**Why it works**: Creates urgency and FOMO (fear of missing out)
**Pro tip**: Announce in assembly: "Who will be in the First 50?"

### 5. Monthly Kindness MVP (Voted by Peers)
**How it works**: Each month, students vote on the most impactful kindness story from the feed
**Reward idea**: Certificate signed by principal, photo on bulletin board, special token bonus
**Why it works**: Peer recognition is more meaningful than adult recognition at this age
**Pro tip**: Read top 3 nominees during morning announcements before voting opens
