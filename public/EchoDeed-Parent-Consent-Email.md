**Subject Line**: Your Child Was Noticed Today — Here's Why That Matters

---

Dear [Parent/Guardian Name],

**Someone noticed your child doing something kind today.**

Maybe they held a door. Helped a classmate. Said something encouraging when no one else did.

These moments happen every day in our school hallways—but too often, they go unrecognized. The students who do the right thing when no one's watching? They rarely hear about it.

**We want to change that.**

### Introducing EchoDeed™ at [School Name]

EchoDeed is a new platform we're bringing to [School Name] that allows students to anonymously share acts of kindness they witness or perform. It's not social media. There's no popularity contest. Just a simple way for students to recognize each other for being good people.

**Here's what happens when your child participates:**
- They can share when they see kindness happening
- They earn tokens for positive participation
- They can redeem tokens for real rewards from local businesses
- They become part of building a kinder school culture

**And here's what's in it for you:**
- You'll receive notifications when your child is recognized
- You'll earn parent rewards too (yes, really)
- You'll see what positive things are happening at school
- You'll have peace of mind knowing the platform is safe

### Why This Matters More Than You Might Think

Research tells us something important: **students who feel like they belong at school show up more, try harder, and struggle less.**

But belonging doesn't come from assemblies or posters. It comes from small moments—someone noticing you, someone saying thank you, someone remembering your name.

EchoDeed captures those moments. And when students see kindness happening around them, something shifts. They start looking for it. They start doing it. They start believing their school is a place where they matter.

**That's the kind of school we want [School Name] to be.**

### Your Consent Is Required

Because your child is under 13, federal law (COPPA) requires us to get your permission before they can participate. This isn't just a checkbox—it's a commitment to you that:

- **Your child's data is protected** — We don't sell, share, or expose personal information
- **All posts are anonymous** — No names attached, no social pressure
- **Content is moderated** — Every post goes through AI filtering AND human review
- **No direct messaging** — Students can't contact each other through the platform
- **You stay informed** — Parent dashboard shows you everything

### To Give Consent:

**Option 1: Online (fastest)**
Click here: [CONSENT LINK]
Takes about 2 minutes.

**Option 2: Paper form**
Your child can bring home a printed form. Sign and return to their homeroom teacher.

### What Happens If You Don't Consent?

That's completely okay. Your child simply won't have access to EchoDeed. They won't be penalized in any way, and their experience at school won't change.

But they will miss out on being part of something positive. And the school will miss out on their voice.

### One More Thing

When we asked students what they wanted from this platform, one 7th grader said:

*"I just want people to know that I try to be nice. Even when it's hard."*

That's the heart of EchoDeed. Not awards. Not competition. Just being seen for trying to do the right thing.

**Your child deserves that.**

## KEY PSYCHOLOGICAL ELEMENTS USED

1. **Lead with emotion, not features** — "Someone noticed your child" creates immediate curiosity
2. **Address the unspoken fear** — Parents worry about another "social media" — we address it directly
3. **Research-backed benefits** — Belonging → attendance → success pipeline
4. **Student voice** — The 7th grader quote humanizes the platform
5. **Dual benefit** — Parent rewards make them stakeholders, not just gatekeepers
6. **Autonomy respect** — "If you don't consent, that's okay" reduces resistance
7. **Future identity** — "The kind of school we want to be" invites them into a vision
8. **Specificity** — "2 minutes" removes friction from the ask
