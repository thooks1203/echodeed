## "You See It!"

**UPDATED**: Based on preferred design direction

---

## Project Overview

**Business Name**: TJ's Body Transformation Services  
**Tagline**: "You See It!"  
**Industry**: Personal Training / Fitness Coaching  
**Target Audience**: Men AND Women (all fitness levels)  
**Vibe**: POWERFUL, Bold, Professional, Results-Driven

---

## APPROVED DESIGN DIRECTION

Based on the preferred concepts, the final logo should follow this style:

### Core Elements (MUST HAVE):

1. **Shield/Badge Shape**
   - Strong, angular shield as the background
   - Metallic/chrome edges with depth and dimension
   - Creates a "crest" or "emblem" feel

2. **Bold "TJ's" or "TBT" Lettering**
   - 3D chrome/metallic effect on letters
   - Red as the primary letter color with silver/chrome accents
   - Glossy, polished finish with highlights
   - Should be the HERO element — largest and most prominent

3. **Male + Female Silhouettes**
   - Positioned on LEFT (male) and RIGHT (female)
   - Both in classic flexing pose (bicep flex)
   - Dark/black silhouettes for contrast
   - Athletic and fit but not intimidatingly huge
   - EQUAL prominence — neither dominates

4. **Dumbbells/Barbells**
   - Integrated into the design (behind or beside the letters)
   - Chrome/metallic finish to match the letters
   - Adds fitness context without being the main focus

5. **Fire/Energy Glow**
   - Orange/red glow effect behind the shield
   - Suggests power, energy, transformation
   - Creates dramatic visual impact
   - Radiating light rays optional

6. **"Body Transformation" Text**
   - Below the main "TJ's" lettering
   - Smaller but still bold and readable
   - Red or white with black outline for contrast

7. **"YOU SEE IT!" Tagline** (IMPORTANT - Currently Missing!)
   - Must be included in final design
   - Positioned below "Body Transformation"
   - Can be in a banner/ribbon or standalone
   - Should feel like a confident declaration

8. **"Services" Text**
   - Include to complete the full business name
   - Can be smaller/subtle but present

## What Makes This Design Powerful

1. **Shield = Strength & Protection** — Implies TJ will protect your transformation journey
2. **Dual Figures = Inclusivity** — Immediately shows men AND women are welcome
3. **Chrome/Metallic = Premium Quality** — Looks professional, not amateur
4. **Fire Glow = Energy & Transformation** — Change is happening, results are coming
5. **Bold Red = Passion & Power** — Commands attention, memorable

## Refinements Needed from Current Drafts

The daughter's designs are 90% there. To make them MORE powerful:

| Current | Improvement |
|---------|-------------|
| Missing tagline | Add "YOU SEE IT!" prominently |
| Missing "Services" | Complete the full business name |
| Fire glow is subtle | Make it more dramatic/radiating |
| Text hierarchy | Ensure "TJ's" is largest, then "Body Transformation", then "Services" |
| Silhouettes same pose | Consider slightly different poses for visual interest |
