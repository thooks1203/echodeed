## Platform Features

### 1. The Explorer 3-Phase Workflow

Unlike high school's 5-phase IPARD system, middle school uses a simplified 3-phase approach:

| Phase | Description | Token Bonus |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Discover** | Students learn about community needs and brainstorm ways to help | 25 tokens |
| **Do** | Students participate in optional community activities | 75 tokens |
| **Share** | Students reflect on their experience and share learnings | 150 tokens |

**Why 3 Phases?** Developmentally appropriate for ages 11-14, reducing complexity while maintaining engagement.

### 2. Optional Community Service Model

**Key Principle:** Service hours are ENCOURAGED but NOT REQUIRED.

- **No mandatory hour goals** - Students participate at their own pace
- **Activity logging available** - Students can track participation without pressure
- **No progress bars or tracking** - Eliminates stress around "falling behind"
- **Celebration focus** - Every activity is celebrated, not measured

**Benefits:**
- Reduces anxiety around requirements
- Allows intrinsic motivation to develop
- Supports students with varying schedules and abilities
- Builds genuine interest in community service

### 3. Token Reward System

| Milestone | Tokens | Reward Examples |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Bronze | 25 | Ice cream treat, stickers |
| Silver | 75 | Spirit items, small prizes |

### 5. Age-Appropriate Messaging

All platform communications use developmentally appropriate language:

| Instead of... | We say... |
|---------------|-----------|
| "Community service hours" | "Community activities" |
| "Required goals" | "Optional adventures" |
| "Service verification" | "Activity celebration" |
| "Diploma tracking" | "Explorer journey" |

### 6. Kindness Mentor Training

Students can become peer mentors with our interactive training modules:

- **Welcome to Kindness Mentoring** (15 min, 50 tokens)
- **Building Trust and Connection** (20 min, 75 tokens)
